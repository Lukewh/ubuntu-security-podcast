** Introduction
*** What will be covered
- Overview of latest security updates for Ubuntu
- In depth discussion of trending CVEs
- Other things the team has been up to
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
*** SegmentSmack (CVE-2018-5390) (USN-3732-1)
- DoS via expensive algorithmic computation in TCP stream reassembly
- Requires attacker to have an existing TCP session
- Affecting kernel >= 4.9
- Fixed in Bionic and Xenial for HWE
- No known exploits in the wild
*** linux kernel (LSN-0041-1)
- brief description of livepatch
- Several issues (5 CVEs)
  - stack overflow in SCSI / cdrom layers
  - DoS / crash via specially crafted ext4 filesystem
  - files can be created with group permissions which the original owner did not have within sgid directories
    - Originally reported by Jann Horn in relation to whoopsie / apport in Ubuntu
  - DoS / crash via specially crafted xfs filesystem
  - SegmentSmack fix
- generic & lowlatency kernels for Trusty, Xenial and Bionic
*** gnupg (CVE-2017-7526) (USN-3733-1)
- Cache side-channel attack on RSA implementation
- When CVE was created, only assigned to libgcrypt
- gnupg quietly announced 1.4.23 as fixing this CVE as well in June
  - Turns out was actually fixed in 1.4.22
  - So Bionic etc not affected
- Fixed in Trusty and Xenial
- No known exploits in the wild
*** openjdk (CVE-2018-2952) (USN-3734-1)
- Denial of service via excessive memory consumption
- openjdk-7 in trusty and openjdk-8 in xenial
*** lxc (CVE-2018-6556) (USN-3730-1)
- Allows opening (but not reading) of arbitrary files
  - Information disclosure / DoS since could open pseudoterminals or other kernel devices and cause exhausting of resources
- For lxc >=2.0 - bionic, xenial-backports
*** libxcursor (CVE-2015-9262) (USN-3729-1)
- Classic off-by-one error - string allocation but forgot to allocate byte for NUL terminator
  - As on the heap allows heap memory corruption
  - Possible code execution etc
  - In handling of cursor themes so could be triggered when loading a malicious themes
- Affects libxcursor in trusty and xenial - both fixed
*** lftp (CVE-2018-10196) (USN-3731-1)
- Command-line FTP / HTTP / BitTorrent clients

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security
*** NCSC publish Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Security Guide
- A couple weeks old now, but worth mentioning
- National Cyber Security Centre in UK
  - Provide infosec guidance to public and private sector
- Focuses around End User Devices deployed for remote work but applies equally to home / office as well
- Covers guidance such as:
  - VPN
  - Enforcing a given password policy
  - UEFI Secure Boot
  - Livepatch
  - Firewall configuration
  - Auditing

*** Seth Arnold's AppArmor 3.0 presentation at DebConf
- Overview of AppArmor with brief history and walkthough of main features
- Efforts to enable AppArmor by default in Debian Buster (10)
- Ongoing work to upstream the latest AppArmor changes
  - Course-grained network mediation (AF_INET / AF_IET6)
  - DBus mediation
    - Almost all are now in Linux kernel 4.19
  - Some remain for 4.20
    - Unix sockets
- Future directions for AppArmor
  - IMA-aware policy (in 4.17, requires AppArmor 3.0 userspace)
    - Contributed by Google, hopefully will be available soon
  - Fine-grained networking mediation (ie. port level mediation)
  - Shared memory mediation
  - cgroups
  - overlayfs
  - user specific policy
- Multiple namespaces support for AppArmor
  - LXD / libvirt / snapd / docker
  - policy within a namespace (and policy outside the namespace too)
- Demo of LXD with namespaced policy
- https://debconf18.debconf.org/talks/106-apparmor-30/
