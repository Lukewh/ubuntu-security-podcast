# Ubuntu Security Podcast

[Ubuntu Security Podcast](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org) is a weekly
podcast by the Ubuntu Security Team, focusing on the latest updates from the
team with a discussion of some of the more interesting vulnerabilities fixed in
the last week, as well as other news and details from the community.

## Website

The website is hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) from an Emacs
[org-mode](https://orgmode.org/)
[document](https://github.com/alexmurray/ubuntu-security-podcast/blob/master/org/episodes.org)
via the [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) package. The [theme](https://github.com/alexmurray/castanet) is
a slightly customised version of
[castanet](https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet) to support the standard
Ubuntu / Canonical colours etc.

The generated site is stored in the `gh-pages` branch and this corresponds
to the `public/` subdirectory in a local checkout:

```shell
 git clone https://github.com/alexmurray/ubuntu-security-podcast.git
 cd ubuntu-security-podcast/
 git submodule init
 git submodule update
 # checkout the gh-pages branch into a public/ directory
 git clone --branch gh-pages \
   https://github.com/alexmurray/ubuntu-security-podcast.git public

 # generate the site locally with hugo
 hugo   # or serve it with hugo server etc as normal
```

## Show notes

To assist in generating show notes, there is an [Emacs Lisp
script](https://github.com/alexmurray/ubuntu-security-podcast/blob/master/org/ubuntu-security-podcast.el)
to auto-generate the boiler plate for a new episode using emails (queried via
[mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html)) to the
[ubuntu-security-announce](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce)
mailing list. This automatically lists each Ubuntu Security Notice (USN) which
was published during the selected time period along with the unique CVEs
mentioned in the USNs, and finally collates the total number of unique CVEs
mentioned in the episode.

Some manual rework is needed to reduce the overall length of the generated show
notes to collate package updates for packages which cover the same CVEs and to
then add details of each of the CVEs plus add details on whatever other topics
were discussed.
