This week we look at some details of the 32 unique CVEs addressed across the supported Ubuntu releases and talk open source software supply chain integrity and how this relates to Ubuntu compared to the recent npm event-stream compromise.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
32 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3826-1/][USN-3826-1]]] QEMU vulnerabilities

  - Integer overflow in virtual network interface driver, able to be triggered
    by user process in guest -> crash -> DoS
  - Heap based buffer overflow in SLiRP, user-based networking stack (default)
    during reassembly of fragmented datagrams
  - Integer overflow when reading large blocks from files - nice PoC on github
  - NVMe emulator missing checks on read / write parameters - OOB heap buffer
    r/w - guest user/process could trigger -> DoS (crash) or possible arbitrary
    code execution on host as qemu process
  - Integer type mismatch in rtl8139 and pcnet drivers - (from size_t to int) - unsigned
    to signed - INT_MAX -> -ve -> OOB read - crash / DoS
    - Copy-pasta?

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3827-1/][USN-3827-1]], USN-3827-2] Samba vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16851][CVE-2018-16851]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1685][CVE-2018-1685]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16841][CVE-2018-16841]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14629][CVE-2018-14629]]
- CNAME records could point to themselves - infinite recursion in internal AD DNS server
  - Users can add CNAME records -> user triggerable
  - Fix ensures CNAMEs can't refer to themselves
- If using smartcard authentication for AD, double free could occur due to mismatch in certificate vs authentication request parameters
  - talloc - robust against heap corruption - assert() fail - exit - DoS
- Null pointer dereference when reading more than 256MB of LDAP entries - DoS crash

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3828-1/][USN-3828-1]]] WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-4386][CVE-2018-4386]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-4372][CVE-2018-4372]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-4345][CVE-2018-4345]]
- Minimal details provided by upstream webkit regarding these advisories:
  - XSS due to improper URL validation
  - Multiple memory corruption issues which could lead to arbitrary code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-3/][USN-3816-3]]] systemd regression
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
- Episode 12 & 13 - backport of large upstream patches to better handle symlink resolution in systemd-tmpfiles
- New code uses openat with O_PATH flag internally
- O_PATH was only introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.39
- Fails on pre-2.6.39 kernels - eg. OpenVZ
- So if running an Ubuntu Xenial kernel on OpenVZ systemd would fail to work correctly
- OpenVZ have released updated kernel as well to support O_PATH

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3829-1/][USN-3829-1]]] Git vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19486][CVE-2018-19486]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-15298][CVE-2017-15298]]
- Previously would execute commands from CWD, rather than from PATH
  - Could allow arbitrary code execution if using a malicious repository
- DoS due to large memory usage (Git Bomb) with specially crafted repository
  - Small repo with only 12 unique objects inside but that which are duplicated across the repo tree
  - Git would usually crash due to running out of memory BUT if did manage to
    survive and write to disk could consume a lot of disk space too
  - Only Trusty and Xenial affected (fixed already in Bionic etc)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3830-1/][USN-3830-1]]] OpenJDK regression
- Recent OpenJDK update (Episode 10) add stricter checking for JAR files
  - As a result, failed to find JAR files during build resulting in failed project builds
- New option should have been disabled by default to give time for other packages to be updated etc to deal wth new behaviour
  - Is now :)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3831-1/][USN-3831-1]]] Ghostscript vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19477][CVE-2018-19477]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19476][CVE-2018-19476]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19475][CVE-2018-19475]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19409][CVE-2018-19409]]
- Even more gs - (Episode 10, 7, 5)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3795-3/][USN-3795-3]]] libssh regression
- [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10933][CVE-2018-10933]] - covered in Episode 8
- Upstream fix introduced a regression which broke server-side keyboard authentication
- Server-side, not client-side
  - Not a common scenario used so unlikely to affect many users as need to use
    multiple interactive keyboard-based prompts to trigger (say password and
    token)
  - Server would be stuck
- Backport upstream fix

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3832-1/][USN-3832-1]], USN-3833-1] Linux kernel (AWS) vulnerabilities
- 6 CVEs addressed in Cosmic, first 2 in Bionic as well
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6559][CVE-2018-6559]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18955][CVE-2018-18955]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18653][CVE-2018-18653]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18445][CVE-2018-18445]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18281][CVE-2018-18281]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17972][CVE-2018-17972]]
- Philipp Wendler discovered Ubuntu specific flaw in the way user namespaces interact with overlayfs
- Allows regular users to list contents of directories which they do not have read-access to (ie could list /root)
- Create a user and a mount namespace and then mount an overlay via overlayfs within it
  - Within the overlayed mount, if say contained "root" and was mounted at the
    filesystem root (/), overlayfs would get confused about which permissions
    to use when running and would not use the real underlying permissions but
    would instead use the user supplied ones from the overlayed fs
- Relates to the fix for a previous CVE ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2015/CVE-2015-1328.html][CVE-2015-1328]])
  - This fix got dropped during Bionic development cycle so reintroduced this similar vulnerability
  - New test added to Ubuntu kernel test suite to ensure this does not regress again in the future

** Open Source Software Supply Chain Integrity
- NPM package (event-stream) got hijacked to inject code to target users of copay (Bitcoin wallet)
- Author of event-stream had lost interest, was emailed by a small contributor to take over maintenance and gave them ownership of the repo
  - Pushed a small change to add a new dependency to the package
  - This then contained code to try and bundle itself with target application - copay-dash
  - Targetted software supply chain at 2 points - event-stream repo / package AND getting into the build-system for copay-dash as a result
    - So would bundle bitcoin wallet stealing code into copay-dash
- 2 software supply chain attacks
  - Hard to fix first one since maintainers can lost interest and hand over to anyone
    - New owner may not have trust the old one did
    - npm doesn't care - is uncurated
  - Copay bundled and distributed dependencies so perhaps should have some responsibility to check those etc
- Ubuntu is based on Debian and both are curated repos
  - Packages are maintained by trusted developers
  - Much harder to mount a similar attach on Ubuntu / Debian archives due to
    barrier to entry as a trusted developer
  - Smaller dependency chains as well compared to npm so harder to hide such an attack as well
- Snap store is a different story though
- Bottom line - have to trust your software suppliers
  - Ubuntu - Canonical / trusted maintainers
  - Snap store - individual publishers

** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
16 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-2/][USN-3816-2]]] systemd vulnerability
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
- Episode 12 - original fix for CVE-2018-6954 was incomplete - this includes the complete fix
- Also includes an update to avoid a possible hang on shutdown in unattended-upgrades - [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1803391][LP #1803391]]
  - During shutdown, systemd is already in the process of shutting down
  - Then unattended-upgrades runs and it goes and tries to update systemd - which then tries to reexec it - which blocks waiting for it to finish shutting down
  - Creates a deadlock since systemd is waiting on unattended-upgrades to finish but u-u is waiting on systemd reexec
  - Fix is to not do reexec if systemd is already in the process of stopping

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3825-1/][USN-3825-1]], USN-3825-2] mod_perl vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2767][CVE-2011-2767]]
- Old CVE - reported to Debian in 2011, who assigned a CVE internally but didn't go any further with it
- Recently the original reporter of the vulnerability submitted a patch to Debian to fix it - so vuln was reported to Mitre
- Now fixed in Ubuntu as well

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3801-2/][USN-3801-2]]] Firefox regressions
- 12 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12397][CVE-2018-12397]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12388][CVE-2018-12388]]
- Firefox update (v63) (Episode 9) had some minor regressions
  - These were present in the upstream firefox release itself
- This provides [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/63.0.3/releasenotes/][63.0.3]] which contains these fixes from upstream to address the regressions

** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
33 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3814-1/][USN-3814-1]]] libmspack vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18585][CVE-2018-18585]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18584][CVE-2018-18584]]
- Out of bounds write of 1 byte when a CAB file uses the maximum Quantum block size - buffer overflow, DoS -> crash, possible code execution
- Failure to validate filenames properly - could accept a filename with embedded NUL bytes - possible DoS -> crash

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3815-1/][USN-3815-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3815-2/][USN-3815-2]]] gettext vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18751][CVE-2018-18751]]
- Double free for specially crafted translations file, DoS -> crash, possible code execution via heap corruption etc.
  - PoC's on github

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-1/][USN-3816-1]]] systemd vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
- Large backport of multiple patch series
- Jann Horn (GPZ) reported two issues to Ubuntu regarding systemd
  - possible to inject / alter state across re-execution of systemd itself (since serialized state) - but fails to deserialize it correctly
    - Insecure use of fgets() when parsing long lines
    - Possible root privilege escalation
  - When changing ownership of files in a directory via systemd (useful for executing a systemd unit as a given user for example to ensure files it needs are owned by that user)
    - Would try and handle symlinks specially BUT this is racy (since could change where pointed to during check of symlink and then actual work of chown() after)
    - So for instance, could convince systemd to possible change the ownership of a root owned file to that of another user
    - So could allow to change arbitrary files ownerships or even permissions
- Third issue - older one, systemd-tmpfiles could be used to obtain ownership of arbitrary files
  - Would follow symlinks in non-terminal path components, and then operate on the resulting file
  - Can tell it to set permissions / ownership of given files
  - So could race it to replace path components with symlinks to root-owned files and get it to change their ownership to that of the user (or whomeever)
  - Original patch series (March) didn't completely fix this - required much more invasive patching later
  - We waited to fix it until the complete fix was available and accepted upstream (August) to then start backporting
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3814-2/][USN-3814-2]], USN-3814-3] ClamAV vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM & Trusty
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18585][CVE-2018-18585]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18584][CVE-2018-18584]]
- Same issues as for libmspack earlier (since clamav in Trusty and Precise ESM embeds libmspack, later releases use the system libmspack package instead)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3811-2/][USN-3811-2]]] SpamAssassin vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-15705][CVE-2017-15705]]
- One of the CVEs for SpamAssassin in Episode 7

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1000030][CVE-2018-1000030]]
- Failure to initialize hash salt for PRNG in hash tables for elementtree (XML parser)
  - Could relatively easily cause hash-collisions on specially crafted document
  - High CPU and memory usage -> DoS
- Possible command injection when using Python to create a ZIP file archive
  - Used spawn() which is vulnerable to shell command injection -> subprocess()
- 3 lower priority issues
  - Race condition in when reading from multiple threads on same file - possible heap buffer overflow or UAF
  - DoS via CPU usage due to regexes in mail server response handling with backtracking - could be triggered by a malicious mail server
  - Similar but in regexes in difflib (catastrophic backtracking)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3818-1/][USN-3818-1]]] PostgreSQL vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16850][CVE-2018-16850]]
- Possible to inject arbitrary SQL with superuser privileges during dump/restore cycle
- Can be triggered by regular users in default config since they can trigger as have CREATE privilege on the public schema

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3819-1/][USN-3819-1]]] Linux kernel vulnerability

- Bluetooth HID integer overflow and info leak in CDROM ioctl (covered in Episode 9 for Xenial kernel)
- Possible privilege escalation via SCSI subsystem
- Xen virtual network driver didn't check supplied parameters -> integer overflow -> OOB read -> possible OOB write -> privilege escalation, DoS etc

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** New Intel Side Channel Attacks (again...)
- [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05441.pdf][A Systematic Evaluation of Transient Execution Attacks and Defenses]]
- Reclassifies existing Meltdown and Spectre attacks with a new nomenclature
  - ie. original Meltdown is now Meltdown-US (US = User/Supervisor)
- Identifies a bunch of other possible variants for both Meltdown and Spectre
  - Meltdown-PK - bypass restrictions on Intel memory protection keys
  - Meltdown-BR - Spectre-like attack but using bounds-range exceeded exception to trigger
  - 5 new Spectre variants based on existing ones but targetting different
    microarchitectural elements (ie targetting the Branch Target Buffer when
    doing a Spectre-RSB attack since some processors fallback to BTB when RSB
    is empty)
- Compares existing mitigations for each existing and newly identified attack
- Very comprehensive, demonstrates the utility of such a complete analysis compared to existing approach where different researchers have looked at a single aspect
- Still an active area of research with new vulnerabilities turning up

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16395][CVE-2018-16395]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16396][CVE-2018-16396]]
- Misuses return value when comparing names in X509 certificates
  - If returned 1 on comparing name would assume are identical but are in fact not
  - Could allow to impersonate a certificate
- Taint flags not propagated when unpacking arrays into strings, or packing strings into arrays
  - Could allow untrusted data to be treated as trusted

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3809-1/][USN-3809-1]]] OpenSSH vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15473][CVE-2018-15473]]

  - Could be triggered on both peer or server side
  - Lack of input validation coupled with an integer overflow lead to crash and possible authentication bypass
  - Leads to memcpy() with a negative length value (and hence very large unsigned value)
  - Theoretically possible to overwrite other data structures related to server state and therefore bypass authentication

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1060][PortSmash]] - New Intel side-channel vulnerability or expected behaviour for SMT?
- [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-5407.html][CVE-2018-5407]] assigned to OpenSSL but described as a side-channel in Intel SMT / Hyper-Threading
  - https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/11/01/4
  - Affects OpenSSL <= 1.1.0h
- [[https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/12/8][Originally suggested as a possible side-channel in 2015]]
- Due to sharing of execution engines in SMT
  - Two processes across shared hyper-threads, contend for execution units across same ports
  - Meaure port contention delay -> side channel to recover ECDSA private key of server running in other process
- So crypto code needs not only to be constant-time, but also secret-independent execution-flow
  - ie. execute same instruction sequence regardless of secret
  - all code and data addresses are assumed public
- Or disable HT / learn to schedule trust domains across different hyper-threads (gang-scheduling)

- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14665][CVE-2018-14665]]
- Incorrect permissions check for 2 command-line arguments (-modulepath and -logfile)
- On *some* platforms (not Ubuntu) Xorg itself is setuid
- Can then use these command-line options to overwrite arbitrary files etc -> privilege escalation to root via say overwrite of /etc/shadow
- Generated a lot of press - *BUT* missed the distinction that Xorg is not really setuid on Ubuntu
- We use Xorg.wrap as setuid to first run and drop permissions if using KMS driver
  - This is the case for the vast majority of drivers, and for almost all free drivers
  - So most Ubuntu users unaffected by this vulnerability
- Special Friday release :)

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12377][CVE-2018-12377]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12376][CVE-2018-12376]]
- New Thunderbird version (60) containing 5 fixes
- Interestingly *all* of these were also vulnerabilities in Firefox - in
  particular CVE-2018-12383 was discussed in Episode 4 for Firefox

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3789-2/][USN-3789-2]]] ClamAV vulnerabilities
- 5 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15378][CVE-2018-15378]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14682][CVE-2018-14682]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14681][CVE-2018-14681]]

- Corresponding fix for Precise ESM from ClamAV which we discussed in Episode 7
- Also rolls in fixes for 4 other vulnerabilities in the embedded mspack library
  - In trusty and precise we used the embedded libmspack, newer releases use
    the system package so weren't affected

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3795-1/][USN-3795-1]]] libssh vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10933][CVE-2018-10933]]
- Embedded SSH server and client implementation
- Allows bypass of authentication by remote attackers if they send a SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS message instead of the SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message to initiate the authentication process
- This message is meant to be sent from the server to the client but in this case are sending it *to the server*
- State machine on server-side then jumps straight to 'Authenticated'
- Only affects applications which use libssh as a server

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3796-1/][USN-3796-1]], USN-3796-2] Paramiko vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic & Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1000805][CVE-2018-1000805]]
- Python SSH library for both servers and clients
- Very similar to CVE-2018-10933 for libssh - remote authentication bypass by presenting SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS in place of SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
- Due to code-reuse between client and server implementations
- On server side, runs the normal client side code to be used when receiving this authentication success from the server, and flips the 'authenticated' flag - which is shared by both the server and client code

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish Released
- Includes OpenSSL 1.1.1 for TLS 1.3 support
- Support for using fingerprint readers to unlock screen etc
  - Ubuntu Security Team consider fingerprints to be akin to usernames only - so we don't enable fingerprint authentication by default - need to opt-in
  - libfprint and fprintd promoted to main to allow this
*** Ubuntu CVE Tracker facelift
- Refreshed look and feel via bootstrap
- https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3771-1/][USN-3771-1]]] strongSwan vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5388][CVE-2018-5388]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10811][CVE-2018-10811]]
- 2 CVEs: flaws in RSA implementation allow Bleichenbacher-style attacks in parsing of the ASN.1 encoded digestInfo
- strongSwan implementation was too lenient and would allow arbitrary random data to be contained following various elements in the ASN.1
- Also would not check the correct amount of padding had been used
- Allows attackers to potentially forge low-exponent signature forgery and hence authentication during IKE authentication
- 2 CVEs for DoS due to missing length check and missing variable initialization
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3772-1/][USN-3772-1]]] UDisks vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17336][CVE-2018-17336]]
- Format string vulnerability which could be exploited via specially crafted disk label
- udisks prints volume label via printf() passing the label as part of the format string
  - Simple fix to replace the label with a %s directive and then pass the label to that
  - ie. don't interpret label as printf() directives directly

*** LSM Stacking upstreaming
- Casey Schaufler (Intel, SMACK maintainer) primary developer along with John Johansen and Kees Cook (Google) to upstream support for LSM stacking
- Currently upstream allows use of one 'major' module (SELinux / AppArmor / Tomoyo) with a minor module (Yama etc)
- Goal of stacking is to allow multiple major modules to be used in conjunction (AppArmor with SELinux)
  - Primary use-case is containers
- Current stacking patches allow to stack Tomoyo with either SELinux / AppArmor
  - Eventually should be able to stack SELinux with AppArmor but still WIP
  - Ubuntu already carries these patches in Bionic etc
- Likely to be merged in the near future
*** Evince AppArmor hardening [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/1788929][LP #1788929]]
- Jann Horn (GPZ) reported gaps in evince AppArmor profile
- Clever use of GNOME thumbnailer infrastructure to specify a new 'evil' thumbnailer and the use of systemd via DBus to escape AppArmor confinement
- Policy fixed in Cosmic, in process of updating for Bionic etc

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3759-1/][USN-3759-1]]] libtirpc vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-8779][CVE-2017-8779]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14622][CVE-2018-14622]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4429][CVE-2016-4429]]
- Transport Independent RPC Library, used by NFS
- 1 medium priority issue:
  - Crash from NULL pointer dereference when run out of file descriptions (failure to check return value) - a remote attacker could cause crash by flooding with new connections
- 2 low priority issues:
  - "rpcbomb" - allows an unauthenticated attacker to DoS via memory exhaustion
  - Stack based buffer overflow could cause a crash when flooded by ICMP and UDP packets in the sunrpc implementation - fixed by replacing stack based memory allocation with heap-based allocation instead
  - Common pattern to fix this type of issue - similar work in Linux kernel recently by KSPP to replace VLAs

- Latest firefox release (62) fixing a number of issues including DoS and RCE
- One interesting one is CVE-2018-12383 - in Firefox 58 the password storage
  format was changed (was sqlite, then was changed to json). When user sets a
  master password, this is used to encrypt all stored passwords. However, this
  was only done for the copy stored with the new format - the old copy would
  still be stored unencrypted since it never had a master password set on
  it. This is now fixed to simply delete the old copy of the password DB.
** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Discussions around hardening guides for Ubuntu
- A number of 'best practices' guides exist for hardening Ubuntu installations from reputable organisations
  - [[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-ubuntu-1804-lts][NCSC]]
  - [[https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux/][CIS Benchmarks]]
  - many others
- In general these have similar recommendations:
  - Use UEFI Secure Boot
  - Disable unnecesary services
  - Use a known and fixed networking configuration (disable DHCP / use VPN etc)
  - Enable Mandatory Access Control frameworks (ie. AppArmor)
  - Use a specific password policy
  - Enable auditing
- Differ in level of detail and technical knowledge needed to deploy
- Typically aimed at computer and network administrators (not end-users)
- Ubuntu already includes a number of these recommendations out of the box:
  - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features
- Ubuntu strives to strike a balance between security and usability out-of-the-box

- Intel microcode updates to address L1TF, Spectre Variant 4 and Rogue System Register Read (RSRE)
- Intel initially released this with a brand new license which included terms around disallowing benchmarking and possibly preventing redistribution via the Ubuntu mirrors
  - As a result, we couldn't provide updated microcode packages to full address L1TF etc
  - Intel have now reverted back to the license used on previous microcode packages and so this can now finally be released

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** MIR Process and bubblewrap
- Security team is responsible for doing security audits of packages which are proposed to be included in the main section of the Ubuntu package repository
  - Packages in main are officially maintained, supported and recommended so deserve a high level of scrutiny before promotion into main
  - Security team historically only provides security updates to packages in main as well
  - So we have to be confident we can maintain and support a given package
- To perform the security review we look at a number of things:
  - The code is evaluated to determine how easy or not it would be to maintain
  - The package itself is evaluated to look for potential issues
  - Code is then evaluated to look for potential existing security vulnerabilities
- This can be a time consuming process, especially to do well
- Recently this was in the news, when Hanno Böck (infosec journalist and
  researcher) and Tavis Ormandy (GPZ) raised the issue of lack of bubblewrap
  support for gnome desktop thumbnailers
  - bubblewrap provides support for sandboxing processes via namespaces and the
    use of it to sandbox desktop thumbnailers was introduced in the GNOME 3.26
    release
  - It was planned to be supported for Ubuntu 18.04, but to do this the package
    had to be moved from universe into main, hence a MIR
  - Due to shifting priorities, the security team was not able to get this done
    in time and hence the feature had to be disabled
  - This MIR is being proritised now so this security hardening feature should be available in an upcoming release
  - Security team is also looking at how to strengthen the hardening via AppArmor MAC profiles in addition
  - Thanks to Hanno and Tavis for giving this greater visibility

L1TF kernel regressions, WPA2 key recovery, mirror fail and more!
#+end_description
** Overview
83 unique CVEs addressed across the supported Ubuntu releases.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-3/][USN-3742-3]]] Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) regressions
- Security team issues USNs for package updates caused by regressions in previous security updates
- Fix for regressions caused by the original kernel update for L1TF
- Could cause Java applications to fail to start and possible kernel panics on
  boot for some hardware configurations
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3745-1/][USN-3745-1]]] wpa_supplicant and hostapd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14526][CVE-2018-14526]]
- Researchers analysed WPA2 4-way handshake via symbolic execution to find weaknesses
  - Found a number of issues including a decryption oracle
  - In this case, the would decrypt but not authenticate frame and then could allow recovery of the group key via a timing side-channel
  - In theory, allows an unauthenticated attacker to recover WPA2 group key via frame manipulation when used with TKIP
    - NOTE: is not advised to use TKIP in practice anyway (should use WPA2/CCMP) and so should have limited applicability
  - In practice, due to large number of attempts needed to recover the full key, this is impractical (especially given that the group key is changed periodically)

- https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/woot2018.pdf
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3746-1/][USN-3746-1]]] APT vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-0501][CVE-2018-0501]]
- Dubbed "mirror fail" by the author and even a website - https://mirror.fail/
- mirror protocol in apt allows to specify a list of mirrors to try rather than just a single mirror in source.list
  - not enabled by default
- in APT 1.6 this was reworked and a bug introduced
  - on fallback from one mirror to the next, the previous mirrors InRelease file would be used without checking the one from the new mirror
  - hence failing to authenticate the one from the new mirror
  - could potentially allow installation of untrusted packages BUT would need at least two mirrors to be compromised AND for the user to have setup use of multiple mirrors in the first place
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3748-1/][USN-3748-1]]] base-files vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6557][CVE-2018-6557]]

*** L1TF and FragmentSmack vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-1/][USN-3740-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-2/][USN-3740-2]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-1/][USN-3741-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-2/][USN-3741-2]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-1/][USN-3742-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-2/][USN-3742-2]])
**** L1TF ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3620][CVE-2018-3620]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3646][CVE-2018-3646]])
- Latest speculative execution cache side channel attack affecting Intel processors
- Allows to access contents from L1 Data Cache via speculative execution,  can then be read by cache side channel
- 3 variants, SGX, SMM and VMM but only 2 affect Ubuntu
- Processors access virtual addresses which need to be translated to physical addresses
- Page Table Entries map from one to the other (contains metadata of page including offset and present bit)
- Pages can be swapped in our out of memory (Present or not) - so if not present then need to do a full page table walk to look up physical address
- But Intel processor will use offset value from PTE even on non-present pages *speculatively*
- For non-present pages, this value is usually junk so can essentially speculatively read arbitrary memory from L1D cache depending on PTE value
- SGX doesn't affect Ubuntu since not used
- SMM fixed via ensuring PTEs of not present pages always refer to non-cacheable memory and hence can't be used for this
- VMM is trickier
  - VMs maintain their own PTEs so also need to ensure they are doing the right thing
  - OR if running untrusted VMs need to do a full L1D flush on switching from host to VM
- Made more trickier by Hyper Threading since sibling hyper-threads share the L1D cache
- So if have different trust domains on sibling hyper-threads may have to disable HT in certain circumstances
**** FragmentSmack ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5391][CVE-2018-5391]])
- Last week was SegmentSmack in TCP fragment reassembly, this week is FragmentSmack
- Similar but for IP fragmentation reassembly
  - Exploiting high algorithmic complexity of IP fragment reassembly code paths to cause DoS
*** GnuPG ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3733-2/][USN-3733-2]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7526][CVE-2017-7526]])
- Last week GnuPG was fixed for Xenial and Trusty for RSA cache side-channel issue
- This is corresponding fix for Precise ESM
***  WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3743-1/][USN-3743-1]])
- 14 CVEs fixed in web content renderer used in many desktop apps

*** Seth Arnold's AppArmor 3.0 presentation at DebConf
- Overview of AppArmor with brief history and walkthough of main features
- Efforts to enable AppArmor by default in Debian Buster (10)
- Ongoing work to upstream the latest AppArmor changes
  - Course-grained network mediation (AF_INET / AF_IET6)
  - DBus mediation
    - Almost all are now in Linux kernel 4.19
  - Some remain for 4.20
    - Unix sockets
- Future directions for AppArmor
  - IMA-aware policy (in 4.17, requires AppArmor 3.0 userspace)
    - Contributed by Google, hopefully will be available soon
  - Fine-grained networking mediation (ie. port level mediation)
  - Shared memory mediation
  - cgroups
  - overlayfs
  - user specific policy
- Multiple namespaces support for AppArmor
  - LXD / libvirt / snapd / docker
  - policy within a namespace (and policy outside the namespace too)
- Demo of LXD with namespaced policy
