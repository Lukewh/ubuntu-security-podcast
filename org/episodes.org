17 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3771-1/][USN-3771-1]]] strongSwan vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5388][CVE-2018-5388]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10811][CVE-2018-10811]]
- 2 CVEs: flaws in RSA implementation allow Bleichenbacher-style attacks in parsing of the ASN.1 encoded digestInfo
- strongSwan implementation was too lenient and would allow arbitrary random data to be contained following various elements in the ASN.1
- Also would not check the correct amount of padding had been used
- Allows attackers to potentially forge low-exponent signature forgery and hence authentication during IKE authentication
- 2 CVEs for DoS due to missing length check and missing variable initialization
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3772-1/][USN-3772-1]]] UDisks vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17336][CVE-2018-17336]]
- Format string vulnerability which could be exploited via specially crafted disk label
- udisks prints volume label via printf() passing the label as part of the format string
  - Simple fix to replace the label with a %s directive and then pass the label to that
  - ie. don't interpret label as printf() directives directly

*** LSM Stacking upstreaming
- Casey Schaufler (Intel, SMACK maintainer) primary developer along with John Johansen and Kees Cook (Google) to upstream support for LSM stacking
- Currently upstream allows use of one 'major' module (SELinux / AppArmor / Tomoyo) with a minor module (Yama etc)
- Goal of stacking is to allow multiple major modules to be used in conjunction (AppArmor with SELinux)
  - Primary use-case is containers
- Current stacking patches allow to stack Tomoyo with either SELinux / AppArmor
  - Eventually should be able to stack SELinux with AppArmor but still WIP
  - Ubuntu already carries these patches in Bionic etc
- Likely to be merged in the near future
*** Evince AppArmor hardening [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/1788929][LP #1788929]]
- Jann Horn (GPZ) reported gaps in evince AppArmor profile
- Clever use of GNOME thumbnailer infrastructure to specify a new 'evil' thumbnailer and the use of systemd via DBus to escape AppArmor confinement
- Policy fixed in Cosmic, in process of updating for Bionic etc

- Ghostscript is used to process Postscript (and other formats) - PS is Turing
  Complete so in general is unsafe
- Hence Ghostscript includes a sandbox (-dSAFER) to try and prevent issues with
  handling of untrusted files
- Tavis Ormandy previously found a number of issues in the SAFER sandbox which
  allowed escape from it and execution of commands (ie. CVE-2016-7977 etc.)

- Transport Independent RPC Library, used by NFS
- 1 medium priority issue:
  - Crash from NULL pointer dereference when run out of file descriptions (failure to check return value) - a remote attacker could cause crash by flooding with new connections
- 2 low priority issues:
  - "rpcbomb" - allows an unauthenticated attacker to DoS via memory exhaustion
  - Stack based buffer overflow could cause a crash when flooded by ICMP and UDP packets in the sunrpc implementation - fixed by replacing stack based memory allocation with heap-based allocation instead
  - Common pattern to fix this type of issue - similar work in Linux kernel recently by KSPP to replace VLAs

- Latest firefox release (62) fixing a number of issues including DoS and RCE
- One interesting one is CVE-2018-12383 - in Firefox 58 the password storage
  format was changed (was sqlite, then was changed to json). When user sets a
  master password, this is used to encrypt all stored passwords. However, this
  was only done for the copy stored with the new format - the old copy would
  still be stored unencrypted since it never had a master password set on
  it. This is now fixed to simply delete the old copy of the password DB.

*** Discussions around hardening guides for Ubuntu
- A number of 'best practices' guides exist for hardening Ubuntu installations from reputable organisations
  - [[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-ubuntu-1804-lts][NCSC]]
  - [[https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux/][CIS Benchmarks]]
  - many others
- In general these have similar recommendations:
  - Use UEFI Secure Boot
  - Disable unnecesary services
  - Use a known and fixed networking configuration (disable DHCP / use VPN etc)
  - Enable Mandatory Access Control frameworks (ie. AppArmor)
  - Use a specific password policy
  - Enable auditing
- Differ in level of detail and technical knowledge needed to deploy
- Typically aimed at computer and network administrators (not end-users)
- Ubuntu already includes a number of these recommendations out of the box:
  - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features
- Ubuntu strives to strike a balance between security and usability out-of-the-box

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** MIR Process and bubblewrap
- Security team is responsible for doing security audits of packages which are proposed to be included in the main section of the Ubuntu package repository
  - Packages in main are officially maintained, supported and recommended so deserve a high level of scrutiny before promotion into main
  - Security team historically only provides security updates to packages in main as well
  - So we have to be confident we can maintain and support a given package
- To perform the security review we look at a number of things:
  - The code is evaluated to determine how easy or not it would be to maintain
  - The package itself is evaluated to look for potential issues
  - Code is then evaluated to look for potential existing security vulnerabilities
- This can be a time consuming process, especially to do well
- Recently this was in the news, when Hanno Böck (infosec journalist and
  researcher) and Tavis Ormandy (GPZ) raised the issue of lack of bubblewrap
  support for gnome desktop thumbnailers
  - bubblewrap provides support for sandboxing processes via namespaces and the
    use of it to sandbox desktop thumbnailers was introduced in the GNOME 3.26
    release
  - It was planned to be supported for Ubuntu 18.04, but to do this the package
    had to be moved from universe into main, hence a MIR
  - Due to shifting priorities, the security team was not able to get this done
    in time and hence the feature had to be disabled
  - This MIR is being proritised now so this security hardening feature should be available in an upcoming release
  - Security team is also looking at how to strengthen the hardening via AppArmor MAC profiles in addition
  - Thanks to Hanno and Tavis for giving this greater visibility

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3745-1/][USN-3745-1]]] wpa_supplicant and hostapd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14526][CVE-2018-14526]]
- Researchers analysed WPA2 4-way handshake via symbolic execution to find weaknesses
  - Found a number of issues including a decryption oracle
  - In this case, the would decrypt but not authenticate frame and then could allow recovery of the group key via a timing side-channel
  - In theory, allows an unauthenticated attacker to recover WPA2 group key via frame manipulation when used with TKIP
    - NOTE: is not advised to use TKIP in practice anyway (should use WPA2/CCMP) and so should have limited applicability
  - In practice, due to large number of attempts needed to recover the full key, this is impractical (especially given that the group key is changed periodically)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3746-1/][USN-3746-1]]] APT vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-0501][CVE-2018-0501]]
- Dubbed "mirror fail" by the author and even a website - https://mirror.fail/
- mirror protocol in apt allows to specify a list of mirrors to try rather than just a single mirror in source.list
  - not enabled by default
- in APT 1.6 this was reworked and a bug introduced
  - on fallback from one mirror to the next, the previous mirrors InRelease file would be used without checking the one from the new mirror
  - hence failing to authenticate the one from the new mirror
  - could potentially allow installation of untrusted packages BUT would need at least two mirrors to be compromised AND for the user to have setup use of multiple mirrors in the first place

*** L1TF and FragmentSmack vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-1/][USN-3740-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-2/][USN-3740-2]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-1/][USN-3741-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-2/][USN-3741-2]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-1/][USN-3742-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-2/][USN-3742-2]])
**** L1TF ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3620][CVE-2018-3620]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3646][CVE-2018-3646]])
- Latest speculative execution cache side channel attack affecting Intel processors
- Allows to access contents from L1 Data Cache via speculative execution,  can then be read by cache side channel
- 3 variants, SGX, SMM and VMM but only 2 affect Ubuntu
- Processors access virtual addresses which need to be translated to physical addresses
- Page Table Entries map from one to the other (contains metadata of page including offset and present bit)
- Pages can be swapped in our out of memory (Present or not) - so if not present then need to do a full page table walk to look up physical address
- But Intel processor will use offset value from PTE even on non-present pages *speculatively*
- For non-present pages, this value is usually junk so can essentially speculatively read arbitrary memory from L1D cache depending on PTE value
- SGX doesn't affect Ubuntu since not used
- SMM fixed via ensuring PTEs of not present pages always refer to non-cacheable memory and hence can't be used for this
- VMM is trickier
  - VMs maintain their own PTEs so also need to ensure they are doing the right thing
  - OR if running untrusted VMs need to do a full L1D flush on switching from host to VM
- Made more trickier by Hyper Threading since sibling hyper-threads share the L1D cache
- So if have different trust domains on sibling hyper-threads may have to disable HT in certain circumstances
**** FragmentSmack ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5391][CVE-2018-5391]])
- Last week was SegmentSmack in TCP fragment reassembly, this week is FragmentSmack
- Similar but for IP fragmentation reassembly
  - Exploiting high algorithmic complexity of IP fragment reassembly code paths to cause DoS
*** GnuPG ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3733-2/][USN-3733-2]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7526][CVE-2017-7526]])
- Last week GnuPG was fixed for Xenial and Trusty for RSA cache side-channel issue
- This is corresponding fix for Precise ESM

- Efforts to enable AppArmor by default in Debian Buster (10)
- Ongoing work to upstream the latest AppArmor changes
  - Course-grained network mediation (AF_INET / AF_IET6)
  - DBus mediation
    - Almost all are now in Linux kernel 4.19
  - Some remain for 4.20
    - Unix sockets
- Future directions for AppArmor
  - IMA-aware policy (in 4.17, requires AppArmor 3.0 userspace)
    - Contributed by Google, hopefully will be available soon
  - Fine-grained networking mediation (ie. port level mediation)
  - Shared memory mediation
  - cgroups
  - overlayfs
  - user specific policy
- Multiple namespaces support for AppArmor
  - LXD / libvirt / snapd / docker
  - policy within a namespace (and policy outside the namespace too)
- Demo of LXD with namespaced policy
- https://debconf18.debconf.org/talks/106-apparmor-30/
