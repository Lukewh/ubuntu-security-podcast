** Overview
Fixes for 19 different vulnerabilities across MySQL, Dovecot, Memcached and others, plus we talk to Joe McManus about the recent iLnkP2P IoT hack and the compromise of DockerHub's credentials database and more.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
19 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3957-1/][USN-3957-1]]] MySQL vulnerabilities
- 8 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2683][CVE-2019-2683]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2632][CVE-2019-2632]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2628][CVE-2019-2628]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2627][CVE-2019-2627]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2614][CVE-2019-2614]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2592][CVE-2019-2592]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2581][CVE-2019-2581]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2566][CVE-2019-2566]]
- Latest upstream version 5.7.26 includes fixes for 8 different issues including:
  - Unauthenticated remote attacker could gain complete access to all MySQL server data
  - Multiple versions of privileged attacker could hang / crash MySQL server

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3958-1/][USN-3958-1]]] GStreamer Base Plugins vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9928][CVE-2019-9928]]
- Heap based buffer overflow in RTSP connection parser - could allow a
  malicious server to gain remote code execution on the client - session id
  can contain attributes separated by semi-colons - would assume when
  encountering a semi-colon that this delimits the maximum size of the
  session id - however the session id has a maximum size of 512 bytes -
  would overflow by using the user-supplied session id length rather than
  sticking to the maximum structure length - changed to only parse up to
  the maximum size of the structure to ensure we then don't overflow when
  copying

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3959-1/][USN-3959-1]]] Evince vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11459][CVE-2019-11459]]
- Failed to check return values when calling functions for libTIFF - these
  return the pixel data from an embedded TIFF image - on failure would end
  up rendering uninitialised memory rather than the TIFF image - fixed to
  check return values and bail out on error

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3960-1/][USN-3960-1]]] WavPack vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11498][CVE-2019-11498]]
- Fuzzing via valgrind - found if no sample rate was specified then a stack
  declared but uninitialized value would be used - could cause a crash etc
  since could be anything - fixed to initialise it to 0 and to check if
  still zero before proceeding to process

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3961-1/][USN-3961-1]]] Dovecot vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11499][CVE-2019-11499]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11494][CVE-2019-11494]]
- Two issues related to authentication in recent versions of dovecot - if
  client aborts authentication the serer could crash due to a NULL pointer
  dereference, and if using TLS but send an invalid authentication message
  could crash as well

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3962-1/][USN-3962-1]]] libpng vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7317][CVE-2019-7317]]
- Use after free in png image cleanup - originally was called under
  png_safe_execute() - this is an internal function which itself calls
  png_image_free() - so after freeing the image would free it a second time
  in certain conditions - changed to just call the free function directly
  rather than via png_safe_execute()

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3963-1/][USN-3963-1]]] Memcached vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11596][CVE-2019-11596]]
- Possible NULL pointer dereference via local command interface due to
  insufficient checks when parsing input - commands require 4 input tokens
  but only checked for 3 (off-by-one) - could allow an attacker with access
  to the command interface to crash memcached

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3953-2/][USN-3953-2]]] PHP vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11035][CVE-2019-11035]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11034][CVE-2019-11034]]
- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-29/][Episode 29]] covered these for standard supported releases - this update is
  for the ESM releases - two bugs in EXIF tag handling

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3964-1/][USN-3964-1]]] python-gnupg vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6690][CVE-2019-6690]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12020][CVE-2018-12020]]
- Possible to trick gnupg to decrypt ciphertext other than the intended one
  when an attacker can control the passphrase to gnupg and the ciphertext
  is assumed trusted - this uses the command-interface of gnupg and passes
  the passphrase directly to it - along with the ciphertext - so if
  attacker includes newlines in the supplied passphrase can then inject
  their own ciphertext (or plaintext in the context of encryption) - fixed
  to check passphrase does not contain line-feed or carriage return
  characters
- Possible to trick by including what looks like the return response from
  gnupg directly in the filename to be decrypted when using verbose output
  mode - fixed by sanitising this filename first

53 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3947-1/][USN-3947-1]], USN-3947-2] Libxslt vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11068][CVE-2019-11068]]
- Library to transform XML via XML definitions
- Includes a security framework since XSLT can define operations to
  fetch/read/write files and resources etc
- Various functions would return 0 if an operation is not allowed by the
  framework which was checked for and correctly disallowed - BUT they could
  also return -1 on error (say from a potentially bad URL) which would not
  be caught and so then would proceed and would fetch from the URL in
  question thereby violating the security policy
- Fixed to also check for error codes on handle the same as an explicit
  policy violation

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3880][CVE-2019-3880]]
- Symlink path traversal vulnerability in the Windows Registry service emulation RPC API end-point
- Allows a local user to create a new registry file anywhere they have Unix
  permissions to do so within the Samba share

  - Also allows to create the file outside the share itself if there is
    already a symlink pointing outside the shared areas
- Fixed by removing the ability to save or restore registry keys at all via
  this RPC API end-point

- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3842][CVE-2019-3842]]
- Failure to properly sanitize environment before using XDG_SEAT
- Attacker could set XDG_SEAT such that they can have actions checked
  against the wrong PolicyKit policy
- Allows a remotely logged in attacker (SSH) to run commands which should
  be restricted to only physically present users
- Fixed by using secure_getenv() rather than just getenv() - so that if
  running via su the existing value is effectively scrubbed from the
  environment and ignored

- By default wget would store the origin URL in an extended attribute on the downloaded file
  - Could include username / password
  - getfattr -d to dump
  - changed to NOT store extended attributes by default AND to strip out
    any credentials when doing so

    - Could allow and attacker to reply across a cluster of servers with
      the same common digest authentication configuration
    - changed to actually use a proper random source
  - Possible OOB read -> crash -> DoS
  - Possible one-byte memory corruption if specify a character encoding of
    only 1 byte (since assumes is at least 2 bytes and so writes a NULL at
    index +2 which could be past the end of the header) - crash, DoS

- Multiple vulnerabilities discovered in the implementation of WPA3 in
  hostapd and wpa_supplicant (aka Dragonblood)
  - 2 apply to SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals , also known as
    Dragonfly Key Exchange) not relevant since we don't enable SAE support
    in our builds (this is used for initial key exchange instead of PSK)
  - 4 apply to the use of EAP-PWD - Extensible Authentication Protocol
    Password
    - cache side channel attack
    - reflection attack
      - may allow an attacker to authenticate without the password but
        likely not derive session key or complete the key exchange so no
        loss of confidentiality
    - 2 failure to validate crypto components
      - could allow attacker to authenticate AND gain access to session key
        and get network access

- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7524][CVE-2019-7524]]
- Local user root privilege escalation
  - Stack buffer overflow - indexer-worker processes missing bounds check when copying from the index
  - If local user can modify the dovecot index then could leverage this
    for code-execution in the indexer process context
  - Mitigated by usual hardening techniques (ASLR, stack-protector,
    read-only GOT (via RELRO & BIND_NOW))

- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-23/][Episode 23]] - fixed kernel to make process start_time via fork() more atomic
- Updated policykit to also check UIDs match (so now checks start_time,
  PID and UID so can't use another user's authorisations)

- Mix of issues across various components in BusyBox
  - udhcpc:
    - Information disclosure of stack memory in dhcp client / server
      (shared component) due to failure to check DHCP options are correct
      size - original fix was incomplete so this got 2 CVEs
    - Heap buffer overflow via DHCP option parsing of OPTION_6RD (IPv6
      rapid deployment on IPv4 infra)
    - Integer overflow -> heap-based OOB write -> crash -> DoS / code
      execution
  - wget:
    - Heap buffer overflow in wget
  - shell:
    - Failure to sanitize filenames during tab completion - could allow
      code execution etc as user who is running the shell
  - archive handling
    - Integer overflow in bzip2 decompression - OOB write - crash -> DoS
      / code execution?
    - Pointer misuse in zip decompression - OOB read - crash -> DoS
    - directory traversal due to symlinks which point outside the
      current working directory when decompressing tar archives
      (tyhicks)
  - module loading
    - allows users to load modules which are otherwise restricted -
      assumes modules could specify the path so uses basename() on the
      module name - so just need to include a / in the module name to
      circumvent other checks

- "Carpe Diem" and others
  - Local root privilege escalation due to an OOB array access resulting
    in arbitrary function call when apache gracefully restarts - done
    daily via logrotate at 6:25am
    - affects mod_prefork, mod_worker and mod_event
    - main server (running as root) shares a memory segment (the
      scoreboard) with low-privileged worker processes
    - PID, last request handled etc - maintained by the worker
    - worker stores an index into global buckets array in the privileged parent
    - this gets used on restart to restart the worker but no check is done to ensure this is valid
    - so since is in shm child can change this index to ensure it points back into the shm segment where it has write access
    - the bucket contains a function pointer to restart worker - so
      since this is now indexed from the shm segment can make this point
      to any function of choice - AND this gets executed as root by the
      parent
    - Requires some other bug to turn this into a remote exploit since
      need to get R/W access remotely on a worker process
  - Failure to normalize URLs in a consistent manner - LocationMatch and
    RewriteRule might not get applied correctly
  - Race condition in mod_auth_digest could allow user with valid
    credentials to impersonate another and bypass access controls
  - read after free on string comparison in mod_http2 - crash, DoS
  - failure to respect session expiry time in mod_session_cookie
  - DoS via slow-loris type attack to occupy server threads

- Jann Horn (GPZ):
  - mmap minimum address bypass - could allow to turn a kernel NULL
    pointer dereference into code execution
  - ASN.1 decoding for SNMP NAT missing length checks - OOB R/W possible
  - side-channel attack due to speculation on pointer arithmetic in eBPF
    programs (Spectre V1)
    - mitigated when secure boot due to lockdown patches blocking BPF
      program loading
  - Reference counting race-condition in KVM -> UAF -> guest VM crash
- UAF + OOPS in IPMI due to race-condition on restart
- Memory leak on error path of vfs read operations -> DoS
- UAF in SCTP sendmsg - crash / code execution
- UAF in AF_ALG due to failure to NULL structure members
  - Originally misclassified by NVD as remotely exploitable, confusion
    over socket() use by crypto API?
- Info leak and a UAF in KVM when using nested virtualisation - not
  enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels unless if install QEMU - this is
  enabled automatically
- 2 different information leak of heap memory in bluetooth subsystem
  triggerable by unauthenticated remote attacker

48 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3919-1/][USN-3919-1]]] Firefox vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9810][CVE-2019-9810]]
- Firefox 66.0.1 (mentioned briefly last week) - fixes two vulnerabilities discovered during Pwn2Own
- Both in the IonMonkey JIT compiler
  - Incorrect alias information for the Array.prototype.slice method
    leads to missing bounds check and a buffer overflow - code execution
    as a result
  - Type confusion in handling of ,__proto__ mutations - ,__proto__ is
    used to modify the Prototype of an object to be mutated - used for
    object inheritance in JavaScript - allows arbitrary memory
    read/write and therefore code execution as a result

- Firefox 66 & 66.0.1 contained a regression - so upstream released 66.0.2
- Broke keyboard handling in Office 365, iCloud and IBM WebMail -
  Firefox 66 changed the way keycode handling works so these websites
  and others which use older, deprecated methods to get the keycode have
  been added to an internal fallback list to use the old method

  thumbnails - OOB read -> crash -> DoS
- OOB read of 1 byte when handling EXIF image data - crash -> DoS
- During file rename, if file is moved across file-systems, the new file
  briefly is world readable allowing anyone to read it - fixed by

- Heap-based buffer overflow in TCP emulation
- OOB read in i2c handling allowing a local attacker within a guest who
  has permission to execute i2c commands could read qemu host process
  stack memory
- Plan9 FS host-directory sharing race-condition on file rename -> crash
  -> DoS
- 2 issues in USB MTP handling:
  - time-of-check to time-of-use error allows attacker with write access
    to the shared host filesystem can use this to navigate host FS in
    context of QEMU host process and read any therefore read any file
    which QEMU can on the host
  - Path traversal flaw due to improper filename sanitisation - allow to
    read-write arbitrary host files -> Dos or code execution on the host
- Updates for Paravirtualised RDMA subsystem:
  - DoS due to infinite loop
  - NULL pointer dereference due to missing read method
  - Fix various memory leaks
  - Various other NULL pointer dereferences plus a failure to check
    parameters leading to possible extreme memory allocation
  - Fix OOB read triggerable by guest

- Apache module to provide authentication and authorisation via SAML 2.0 IdP
- Possible to bypass authorisation checks when also using mod_proxy
- Fix an open-redirect via the logout endpoint - could encode an
  absolute URL using backward-slashes (\) in place of forward-slashes
  (/) and this would be propagated by the endpoint to the client where
  the browser would convert these and follow the redirect - due to
  mismatch in how browsers will convert these but apache's own internal
  URI parsing does not

- https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/keeping-passwords-secure/

*** Ubuntu Hardening Tips
- Paul Waring got in touch to mention his tips for hardening new Ubuntu installations:
  - Install and configure unattended-upgrades
  - Install UFW and block all incoming connections except specific services
    - Can be done easily via ansible from just a few lines of YAML
  - For servers:
    - Install SSHGuard to ban IP addresses with too many failed login attempts
    - Require TLS for all services via LetsEncrypt + certbot
    - Configure SSH to permit only key-based authentication
    - For wordpress installations - install wp-cli to auto-update themes
      and plugins
  - Automate as much of this as possible for automatic hardening

- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9755][CVE-2019-9755]]
- Discovered recently by Chris Coulson during code-audit of ntfs-3g -
  actually had been fixed upstream late last year but no CVE assigned
- Heap buffer overflow able to be triggered when mounting a filesystem
  onto a mount point with path name greater than PATH_MAX, and from a
  current working directory which has a path name also greater than
  PATH_MAX
- Contents of buffers is attacker controlled so heap can be overflown
  with attacker controlled input - likely to leverage into arbitrary
  code execution
- Contrived example BUT in Debian and Ubuntu ntfs-3g is setuid root -
  which then leads to root privilege escalation with arbitrary code
  execution
- Update was released within hours of the bug being made public to fix
  the heap buffer overflow
- Currently testing ntfs-3g as not-setuid root to release in a future
  update to avoid any other possible privilege escalation bugs in the
  future

- Similar to previous CVE, forceput operator could be extracted from the
  DefineResource method to allow access to the file-system outside of
  the -dSAFER sandbox
- superexec operator was available in the internal dictionary - also
  able to be extracted and hence used to access files outside the

- Almost latest Firefox release (this is 66, 66.0.1 was released Friday after Pwn2Own
  last week so expect another Firefox update today or tomorrow)
  - Multiple memory safety issues fixed, possible code execution as a result
  - 3 issues in FTP modal dialogs allow to either DoS user via
    successive dialogs, or conduct social engineering attacks against
    the user
  - Possible information leak from parent to child process via IPC channels

    disabled (these are enabled by default so user would have to
    explicitly disable them)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3917-1/][USN-3917-1]]] snapd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7303][CVE-2019-7303]]
- Jann Horn reported the seccomp blacklist for TIOCSTI can be bypassed
- snapd creates a seccomp filter for each snap which is designed to
  block TIOCSTI (as this can be used to fake input to other processes
  outside of the sandbox)
- This is a 32-bit value to the ioctl system call, but on 64-bit
  architectures the kernel does this comparison as a 64-bit integer - so
  can be circumvented by using a 64-bit value to ioctl systemcall which
  has other bits set in the upper 32 bits - since when seccomp does
  comparison it uses the full 64 bits - so it won't match the 32-bit
  value of TIOCSTI and so will be allowed - but then when used as the
  ioctl() argument it will correctly be truncated to 32-bits and the
  ioctl will proceed
- Fixed in snapd to add a second seccomp filter to disallow anything in
  the upper 32-bits
- Initially seemed like a kernel or libseccomp issue but both currently
  document this as a limitation already so treated in the end as a
  vulnerability in snapd

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3916-1/][USN-3916-1]]] libsolv vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20534][CVE-2018-20534]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20532][CVE-2018-20532]]
- Dependency solver used by packaging systems to resolve dependencies
  between packages etc
- 2 NULL pointer dereferences and 1 invalid memory read due to
  mishandling of variable length function arguments - all crash -> DoS

10 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3885-2/][USN-3885-2]]] OpenSSH vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6111][CVE-2019-6111]]
- Originally covered in [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-20][Episode 20]] (malicious server could overwrite local client files)
- Previous fix was incomplete - missing a patch

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3901-1/][USN-3901-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3901-2/][USN-3901-2]]] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Trusty & Xenial (Bionic HWE kernel)
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6133][CVE-2019-6133]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19854][CVE-2018-19854]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18397][CVE-2018-18397]]
- 2 out of 3 from Jann Horn
  - PolicyKit provides ability to authorise an application to perform privileged actions
  - Pops up dialog for use to authorise via password - PolicyKit then caches that authorisation (5mins)
  - To identify same process in future, would look at both the PID and process start time to guard against PID reuse etc
  - However, fork() system call is not atomic, so attacked could call sys_clone() at same time as real process so it has the same start time. Can then cause kernel to block on returning back to the attacker process, effectively racing against the real process waiting for it to end, in the meantime blocking PID allocation until it has cycled around and end up with the same (reused) PID as the original authorised process (and with same start time) - so can effectively fool PolicyKit into impersonating the real process
  - Fix kernel to make fork() atomic rather than try fix PolicyKit since can't effectively do this at the process level
  - Kernel fixed to record process start time later in procedure so is much closer to when the process is visible to userspace and after userspace has a chance to delay it to mitigate this

  - Jann also discovered that userfaultfd does not properly handle access control for certain ioctl() - which allowed local users to write data into holes in a tmpfs file, even if the user only had read-only access to the file
- crypto subsystem would leak uninitialized stack memory to userspace
  - Occurred from a recent change to convert strncpy() to strlcpy() used to copy strings into various crypto buffers
  - strncpy() does not guarantee NULL termination so strlcpy() was used which does - HOWEVER, strncpy() would NULL pad out remaining bytes if buffer was longer than string - whereas strlcpy() would only NULL the first one - and so would have uninitialised bytes remaining
  - Fixed by changing back to strncpy()

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3903-1/][USN-3903-1]], USN-3903-2] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Cosmic & Bionic (Cosmic HWE kernel)
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6133][CVE-2019-6133]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18397][CVE-2018-18397]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16880][CVE-2018-16880]]
- fork() start time and userfaultfd issues described earlier for the Bionic kernel update
- Out of bounds write in vhost_net driver used by virtualized guests - allows guest to corrupt host kernel memory -> host crash -> DoS, or possible arbitrary code execution in host kernel

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3902-1/][USN-3902-1]]] PHP vulnerabilities
- 5 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9023][CVE-2019-9023]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9020][CVE-2019-9020]]
- All allow a remote attacker to crash PHP -> DoS
- 2 in XML-RPC module - remote procedure call via XML - used for various wiki backends etc - heap OOB read / UAF
- 1 in PHAR (PHP Archive) module - incorrect handling of filenames - crash via upload of crafted PHAR archive due to a heap based buffer over-read
- 1 in DNS handling (only affects PHP in Xenial) - remote attacker who can control returned DNS response could crash PHP due to buffer over-read on memcpy()
- 1 in mbstring regular expression - multiple heap based buffer over-reads in handling of multibyte sequences in regular expressions

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3904-1/][USN-3904-1]]] NVIDIA graphics drivers vulnerability
- 1 CVE addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6260][CVE-2018-6260]]
- Recent research into GPU side-channel attacks
  - [[https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/pub/ccs18_gpu_side_channel.pdf][Rendered Insecure: GPU Side Channel A!acks are Practical]]
- Local users could access GPU performance counters without special privileges
- Allows to characterise the GPU workload to fingerprint websites etc being rendered
- Now requires administrator privileges to access so unable to be done from a regular user

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Ubuntu Hardening Guide
- Ubuntu tries to offer a usable, hardened approach out of the box
  - No open ports, various kernel and compiler hardening options etc

  - Attacker can learn plaintext by modifying ciphertext and observing different behaviour

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3900-1/][USN-3900-1]]] GD vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic

- Double free if failed to properly extract image file - crash -> DoS
- Heap-based buffer overflow in color matching (able to be triggered by a specially crafted image) - crash -> DoS, possible code execution

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Comparison of Linux Hardening across distributions
- https://capsule8.com/blog/millions-of-binaries-later-a-look-into-linux-hardening-in-the-wild/
- Analyses binaries from various Linux distributions looking for hardening features (OpenSUSE, Debian, CentOS, RHEL & Ubuntu)
- Compare kernel configuration vs KSPP recommendations
- Ubuntu 18.04 ranks highest, due to proactive hardening features baked into toolchain and newer kernel taking advantage of KSPP upstream features
  - gcc is patched so anyone building on Ubuntu gets these features
  - build.snapcraft.io too
  - however is missing stack clash mitigation
- Plan to add more hardening features for 19.10 (stack clash and control-flow integrity support via gcc) and review kernel options cf. KSPP

*** Q&A
**** Does numerous bugs and regressions in Ghostscript indicate it is reaching it's EOL?
- [[https://twitter.com/docEbrown1/status/1101452172196163585][doc-E-brown via twitter]]
- Lots of recent focus -> finds bugs
- ghostscript codebase is old and gnarly and some fixes have been quite invasive
- Any new code could introduce new bugs - particularly complicated fixes -> creates more bugs (regressions)
  - (as doc-E-brown suggests, regressions indicate old code-base)
- Tavis (and others) seem to be looking elsewhere but likely still more bugs to be found
- Would be great if GS could either be made safer or a safer alternative but no-one is stepping up
- Sadly No good viable alternative currently

** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
15 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3886-1/][USN-3886-1]]] poppler vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7310][CVE-2019-7310]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20551][CVE-2018-20551]]
- Two DoS:
  - Out-of-bounds heap buffer read due to missing check for a negative index -> crash -> DoS
  - Crash due to hitting an assertion -> DoS

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3888-1/][USN-3888-1]]] GVfs vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3827][CVE-2019-3827]]
- Possible to allow a local user with admin privileges (eg. sudo group) to read arbitrary files without prompting for authorisation IF no policykit agents running
  - Policykit agents run by default so would require user to be running a difffent DE or to have uninstalled / disabled them
  - Also low impact since user has authority anyway

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3889-1/][USN-3889-1]]] WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6215][CVE-2019-6215]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6212][CVE-2019-6212]]
- Memory corruption and type confusion errors - leading to possible remote code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3890-1/][USN-3890-1]]] Django vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6975][CVE-2019-6975]]
- Could cause Django to consume a large amount of memory when formatting a decimal number with a large number of digits or with a large exponent since it would simply print every single provided character
- Possible DoS although would need a very large number to be input
- Fix is to format numbers with more than 200 characters in scientific notation

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3887-1/][USN-3887-1]]] snapd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7304][CVE-2019-7304]]
- [[https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/02/13/Dirty-Sock.html]['DirtySock' - discovered by Chris Moberly]]
- Failed to correctly parse and validate the remote socket address
- Code had undergone refactoring and introduced this bug
- Allows to impersonate privileged user and therefore call privileged APIs via the snapd socket

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3850-2/][USN-3850-2]]] NSS vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12404][CVE-2018-12404]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12384][CVE-2018-12384]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-0495][CVE-2018-0495]]
- Covered back in [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-17/][Episode 17]]

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3891-1/][USN-3891-1]]] systemd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6454][CVE-2019-6454]]
- [[https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/18/3][Discovered by Ubuntu Security team member Chris Coulson]]
- Stack buffer overflow of DBus path field - declared as VLA, but sender could use a value larger than the stack size and therefore jump the entire stack and the guard pages
- Segmentation violation -> crash -> DoS
  - systemd does not automatically restart so brings down entire system - reboot
- Possible code execution but unlikely
- DBus and systemd need to agree on what the maximum size of various elements are - DBus spec says path could be unlimited - but in practice is less than 32MB! (dbus-daemon limits messages to this size) - systemd now limits path to 64KB AND ensures it keeps running after receiving an invalid sized path

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3892-1/][USN-3892-1]]] GDM vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3825][CVE-2019-3825]]
- Logic error in handing of timed logins (not enabled by default)
- If screen already locked, select to log in as different user - then select a user which has timed login enabled - after timeout will unlock screen of original user
- Need administrator privileges to enabled timed login for a given user so low impact

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3866-2/][USN-3866-2]]] Ghostscript regression
- Affecting Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
- Previous update for Ghostscript ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3866-1/][USN-3866-1]] - [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-18/][Episode 18]]) caused a regression in printing 4"x6" (v9.26 - upstream bug)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3893-1/][USN-3893-1]]] Bind vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6465][CVE-2019-6465]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5745][CVE-2018-5745]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5744][CVE-2018-5744]]
- Fail to properly apply controls to zone transfers - could allow clients to request and receive a zone transfer to a dynamically loadable zone contrary to the allow-transfer ACL
- Assertion failure if a trust anchor's keys are replaced with keys using an unsupported algorithm during a key rollover when using the managed-keys feature for DNSSEC validation
- Remotely triggerable memory leak when processing particular packets - DoS

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** snapd, systemd and handling of embargoed issues
- 2 updates involving close communication between Ubuntu Security Team and external stakeholders - embargoed
- Responsible Disclosure - allows to coordinate a fix in a timely manner and then release update once all parties are ready in a coordinated manner
- Set CRD with stakeholders (reporter, upstream, other distros etc)
- Coordinate fix with upstream and other distros
- Plan coordinated updates to be released with other distros / upstream at CRD

- OOB read on reading USB device descriptor  - need local physical access to connect a malicious device - crash -> DoS
- UAF in ALSA via a malicious USB sound device that expose zero interfaces - crash -> DoS, possible code execution
- Uninitialised ioapics ([[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-19/][Episode 19]])
- Cleancache subsystem - after file truncation (removal), wouldn't properly clear inode so if a new file was created with the same inode might contain leftover pages from cleancache and hence the data from the old file
  - Only affects Ubuntu kernels under Xen with tmem driver

    etc
  - and this can refer to a file on the local filesystem outside the
    document structure itself
  - libreoffice ships with it's own Python interpreter that contains
    functions which can be abused to run arbitrary commands

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20685][CVE-2018-20685]]
- Three vulnerabilities in scp able to be triggered via a malicious server (low probability)
  - Fails to validate file names from the remote server match the requested ones - server can overwrite arbitrary files on local side in the target directory
  - Fails to use proper character encoding in progress display, allows server to manipulate output of client to hide output of additional files being sent
  - Fails to check if target filename is . or empty - allows remote server to change permissions of the client local directory
- Together allow a server to easily overwrite local files on the client side without the client user being aware

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** FAQs about Ubuntu Security
**** What packages are supported?
- main only (~2.3k source packages in Bionic - cf. universe ~26k source packages)
**** What timeframe?
- lifetime of the release - so from official release date to EOL date
- LTS: 5 years, non-LTS: 9 months
- [[https://www.ubuntu.com/esm][ESM provides security fixes beyond the EOL for LTS releases]]
**** Why do we backport patches instead of just updating to the lastest versions?
- Users expect high degree of stability
  - changes need caution and good rationale
  - lots of previous regressions from innocent looking changes
  - no change is completely free of risk
- Only changes which have high impact (security fixes, severe regressions, loss of data etc)
- More details see [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Why][SRU page on Ubuntu wiki]]
- So security updates must follow suit

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** An update on mincore()
- In [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-17/][Episode 17]] discussed changes to mincore() mitigate page cache side-channel attack
- Linus Torvalds committed a change to change the behaviour of mincore() to mitigate the vulnerability
- [[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=30bac164aca750892b93eef350439a0562a68647][Recently reverted that change]] citing too much breakage to existing users:
  - In particular Netflix have a use-case where they dump page cache across processes to aid in migration of Cassandra workloads across machines
- Instead an alternate approach to limit cache residency reporting only to processes which have write access to the particular file in question
  - ie. so if a process has write access to a file which it has open for writing it will be able to read back from mincore() which pages are mapped in the cache and which are not - so will still work for the Netflix and others case of databases wanting to know which pages are mapped or not from disk
  - will stop the case of being able to know which pages of shared system libraries etc are mapped and hence stop the original side-channel attack
  - [[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jikos/jikos.git/log/?h=pagecache-sidechannel-v2][patches not yet submitted for mm tree or others but should be soon]]

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
** apt / apt-get RCE (CVE-2019-3462)
- Discovered by Max Justicz ([[HTTPS://justi.cz/security/2019/01/22/apt-rce.html][provides a detailed write-up on his blog]])
- apt uses worker processes which communicate back to the main process when fetching content
  - workers get told what to download and where to put it and communicate back with parent via stdin/stdout
  - protocol is like HTTP, human readable text
  - can include directives from workers regarding redirects, completion (DONE) etc
  - when handling a HTTP Redirect from the server, apt http worker would append this contents in message sent back to parent
    - expect just a URI as the redirect content but could be anything - so could contain directives in the apt worker protocol which then get interpreted by the main apt process
    - so could signal DONE to parent *as well* as follow-up directives such as reporting false hashes for debs or even falsifying the location of the deb on the filesystem
    - So could use the Releases.gpg file as the location of the package on the filesystem - and actually inject our malicious package into the start of Releases.gpg - with trusted Releases.gpg content afterwards
    - Releases.gpg will still validate (since it ignores junk at the start) AND apt will still use the package since it will ignore the signature at the end
    - So can get malicious package installed - which due to debian packaging can run scripts on install etc and hence get RCE as root :(
- Fixed by simply disallowing control characters in HTTP redirect responses
- If we assume the mirrors are trusted, could have been mitigated via HTTPS
  - Since HTTPS would stop MITM attacks
  - Some Ubuntu mirrors offer HTTPS but this is not enabled by default since not *all* mirrors offer HTTPS
  - Official mirrors do not currently offer HTTPS - this is being reevaluated but is difficult for a number of reasons
  - Users can still easily enable HTTPS themselves by choosing an appropriate mirror with a HTTPS URI
- If assume mirrors are untrusted then they could still have exploited this
  - So whilst HTTPS could help in this case is not a panacea

- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1000858][CVE-2018-1000858]]
- GnuPG includes support for Web Key Directories (WKD) to allow easy discovery of public keys via HTTPS
- Allows a key to be imported from a webserver -> first need to lookup hostname via DNS SRV
- Fails to sanitize response - so performs an attacker controlled, arbitrary HTTPS GET request
  - Attacker needs to construct a malicious SRV record for the domain in question
- Possible CSRF, content injection etc
- Thunderbird will automatically use WKD via GnuPG to lookup missing keys so allows easy exploitation

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16864][CVE-2018-16864]]
- "System Down" systemd vulnerabilities
- Chris Coulson put in a heroic effort and patched quickly - Ubuntu first affected distro to release patched systemd
- Due to use of variable length arrays on the stack, allows various fields which are attacker controlled to be overflowed
- If overflow far enough can bypass kernel stack guard pages, and hence corrupt the heap
- Possible code execution as a result (original advisory contained a PoC for i386 which gained control of the instruction pointer)
- Can be mitigated via use of the gcc flag -fstack-clash-protection - this is now under review to be used by default in forthcoming Ubuntu releases

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3856-1/][USN-3856-1]]] GNOME Bluetooth vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10910][CVE-2018-10910]]
- BlueZ doesn't necessarily make bluetooth device undiscoverable automatically after timeout
- Hence after enabling discovery would then still be discoverable even though user expectation is that is not anymore
- Actual bug then is really in BlueZ but now added a workaround in GNOME bluetooth to manually disable discovery

** Goings on in Ubuntu and Linux Security Community
*** New page cache side-channel attack via mincore()
- Discovered by a team of researchers including some of those who found Spectre / Meltdown
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01161.pdf
- Uses mincore() system call on Linux to determine if pages exist in the page cache or not
- mincore() returns a bitmask of which pages are mapped in the cache for the requested range
- Can use this side-channel to either:
  - determine when a process calls a given function in a shared library (since the library will be mapped at the same address in both the attack and victim process)
    - need to first evict the given page from the cache which is difficult but authors propose a new efficient mechanism to do this
    - can then do things like UI redressing etc in response
  - Or can use this is a covert channel to leak information from one process to another
  - Can even use over the network to leak information via an innocent webserver etc
- Paper also describes an efficient cache eviction strategy
- Linus directly applied a fix (https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=574823bfab82d9d8fa47f422778043fbb4b4f50e)
  - This changes the behaviour of mincore() to only report pages which have been faulted into the cache by the calling process
    - So at best can now observe when a page is evicted from the cache but can't see when another process faults in a page
  - Breaks user-space API of mincore() and hence some existing programs (as noted in the commit)
    - Linus' primary rule is to never break userspace BUT in this case as is a security vulnerability this is okay
    - This might also likely affect other programs that use mincore in Ubuntu etc (fincore, e4defrag, qemu etc)
- Fix is not in the stable upstream kernel yet as waiting to see what fallout there is and so also has not been applied to Ubuntu kernels yet
- Also good discussion on LWN https://lwn.net/Articles/776801/ which highlights other avenues for inferring the contents of the page cache and other possible changes to mincore to protect against this attack
- Will be interesting to see where this all ends up

** Overview
Last episode for 2018! This week we look at CVEs in lxml, CUPS, pixman, FreeRDP & more, plus we discuss the security of home routers as evaluated by C-ITL.

** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
21 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3841-1/][USN-3841-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3841-2/][USN-3841-2]]] lxml vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19787][CVE-2018-19787]]
- Popular XML/HTML parser for Python
- Tries to remove clean input document and remove links (to say embedded
  javascript code) - but doesn't account for links containing escaped
  characters - so link could persist
- Similar to CVE-2014-3146
  - In this case tried to account for whitespace in links but didn't include
    all possible whitespace characters

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3842-1/][USN-3842-1]]] CUPS vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-4700][CVE-2018-4700]]
- Session cookies used for authentication to CUPS web interface used only the
  current time *in seconds* as a seed for the relatively predictable PRNG
  - Easy to bruteforce / guess
  - Fix ensures to use current time value including microseconds
  - Still using relatively predictable PRNG - should use /dev/urandom etc

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3837-2/][USN-3837-2]]] poppler regression

- Various heap-based buffer overflows (crash -> DoS / RCE?)
- Out-of-bounds read (crash -> DoS)

** Goings on in Linux Security Community
*** Linux on MIPS and home routers
- Cyber-ITL (Independent Testing Lab) analysed a number of home routers for basic security hardening features
  - ASLR, DEP (non-executable stack), RELRO
  - Mix of MIPS and ARM devices
  - Compared against Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x86_64 (general hardening)
  - Most found to have minimal hardening features enabled
  - https://cyber-itl.org/assets/papers/2018/build_safety_of_software_in_28_popular_home_routers.pdf
  - Also found Linux kernel on MIPS either has executable stack (until 2016)
    due to FP emulation code, or since then has no executable stack but has a
    RWX segment at a fixed location, which can be used to bypass DEP / ASLR
    - Ubuntu does not support MIPS

*** Final episode for 2018
- This is the last episode for 2018, on leave for the next 3 weeks
- Next episode will be from Cape Town in 2019 during week of 14th January with some special guests... :)

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17972][CVE-2018-17972]]

- Episode 14 covered CVE-2018-6559 (overlayfs / user namespace directory names disclosure)
  - Also fixed for Bionic and Xenial
- Episode 12 covered CVE-2018-17972 (procfs kernel stack disclosure)
- 3 CVEs discovered by Jann Horn (and one inadvertently caused by Jann too)
  - mremap() system call - used to expand or shrink an existing
    memory mapping and possibly move it - doesn't properly flush TLB - could
    leave pages in page cache for a short time which can then be raced to obtain
    access afterwards and possible DoS crash or information disclosure etc
    depending on target memory
  - Previous fix for CVE-2017-17852 (BPF verifier) discovered and also fixed by
    Jann, introduced a new vulnerability which would allow BPF programs to
    access memory out-of-bounds
  - Nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID mappings could allow
    processes with CAP_SYS_ADMIN within the namespace to access resources
    outside the namespace as the kernel would get confused on which UID to
    check against outside the namespace
    - Also fixed in Bionic and Xenial
- Vulnerability specific to the Ubuntu kernel used in Cosmic (18.10)
  - 2 bugs discovered as a result of using the secure boot lockdown patchset
    - Module signatures not properly enforced for UEFI Secure Boot - we had
      enabled the option to do this via IMA but had not then included the IMA
      policy to ensure this was enforced
      - Fixed by turning off option to verify modules using IMA
    - Secondary kernel keyring (ie where UEFI MOK goes from shim - used by
      DKMS) not trusted - so modules signed with it wouldn't work (except they
      do due to above)
      - Fixed to trust keys in secondary keyring for module signing

  constant time *and* execution flow independent of secret key
- Timing side-channels in ECDSA and DSA signature algorithms found by Samuel Weiser

  - Users can add CNAME records -> user triggerable
  - Fix ensures CNAMEs can't refer to themselves
- If using smartcard authentication for AD, double free could occur due to mismatch in certificate vs authentication request parameters

- Minimal details provided by upstream webkit regarding these advisories:
  - XSS due to improper URL validation
  - Multiple memory corruption issues which could lead to arbitrary code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-3/][USN-3816-3]]] systemd regression
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
- Episode 12 & 13 - backport of large upstream patches to better handle symlink resolution in systemd-tmpfiles
- New code uses openat with O_PATH flag internally
- O_PATH was only introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.39
- Fails on pre-2.6.39 kernels - eg. OpenVZ
- So if running an Ubuntu Xenial kernel on OpenVZ systemd would fail to work correctly
- OpenVZ have released updated kernel as well to support O_PATH

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3829-1/][USN-3829-1]]] Git vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19486][CVE-2018-19486]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-15298][CVE-2017-15298]]
- Previously would execute commands from CWD, rather than from PATH
  - Could allow arbitrary code execution if using a malicious repository
- DoS due to large memory usage (Git Bomb) with specially crafted repository
  - Small repo with only 12 unique objects inside but that which are duplicated across the repo tree
  - Git would usually crash due to running out of memory BUT if did manage to
    survive and write to disk could consume a lot of disk space too
  - Only Trusty and Xenial affected (fixed already in Bionic etc)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3830-1/][USN-3830-1]]] OpenJDK regression
- Recent OpenJDK update (Episode 10) add stricter checking for JAR files
  - As a result, failed to find JAR files during build resulting in failed project builds
- New option should have been disabled by default to give time for other packages to be updated etc to deal wth new behaviour
  - Is now :)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3831-1/][USN-3831-1]]] Ghostscript vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19477][CVE-2018-19477]]

- Even more gs - (Episode 10, 7, 5)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3795-3/][USN-3795-3]]] libssh regression
- [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10933][CVE-2018-10933]] - covered in Episode 8
- Upstream fix introduced a regression which broke server-side keyboard authentication
- Server-side, not client-side
  - Not a common scenario used so unlikely to affect many users as need to use
    multiple interactive keyboard-based prompts to trigger (say password and
    token)
  - Server would be stuck
- Backport upstream fix

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3832-1/][USN-3832-1]], USN-3833-1] Linux kernel (AWS) vulnerabilities
- 6 CVEs addressed in Cosmic, first 2 in Bionic as well
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6559][CVE-2018-6559]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18955][CVE-2018-18955]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18281][CVE-2018-18281]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17972][CVE-2018-17972]]
- Philipp Wendler discovered Ubuntu specific flaw in the way user namespaces interact with overlayfs
- Allows regular users to list contents of directories which they do not have read-access to (ie could list /root)
- Create a user and a mount namespace and then mount an overlay via overlayfs within it
  - Within the overlayed mount, if say contained "root" and was mounted at the
    filesystem root (/), overlayfs would get confused about which permissions
    to use when running and would not use the real underlying permissions but
    would instead use the user supplied ones from the overlayed fs
- Relates to the fix for a previous CVE ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2015/CVE-2015-1328.html][CVE-2015-1328]])
  - This fix got dropped during Bionic development cycle so reintroduced this similar vulnerability
  - New test added to Ubuntu kernel test suite to ensure this does not regress again in the future

** Open Source Software Supply Chain Integrity
- NPM package (event-stream) got hijacked to inject code to target users of copay (Bitcoin wallet)
- Author of event-stream had lost interest, was emailed by a small contributor to take over maintenance and gave them ownership of the repo
  - Pushed a small change to add a new dependency to the package
  - This then contained code to try and bundle itself with target application - copay-dash
  - Targetted software supply chain at 2 points - event-stream repo / package AND getting into the build-system for copay-dash as a result
    - So would bundle bitcoin wallet stealing code into copay-dash
- 2 software supply chain attacks
  - Hard to fix first one since maintainers can lost interest and hand over to anyone
    - New owner may not have trust the old one did
    - npm doesn't care - is uncurated
  - Copay bundled and distributed dependencies so perhaps should have some responsibility to check those etc
- Ubuntu is based on Debian and both are curated repos
  - Packages are maintained by trusted developers
  - Much harder to mount a similar attach on Ubuntu / Debian archives due to
    barrier to entry as a trusted developer
  - Smaller dependency chains as well compared to npm so harder to hide such an attack as well
- Snap store is a different story though
- Bottom line - have to trust your software suppliers
  - Ubuntu - Canonical / trusted maintainers
  - Snap store - individual publishers

** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
16 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-2/][USN-3816-2]]] systemd vulnerability
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
- Episode 12 - original fix for CVE-2018-6954 was incomplete - this includes the complete fix
- Also includes an update to avoid a possible hang on shutdown in unattended-upgrades - [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1803391][LP #1803391]]
  - During shutdown, systemd is already in the process of shutting down
  - Then unattended-upgrades runs and it goes and tries to update systemd - which then tries to reexec it - which blocks waiting for it to finish shutting down
  - Creates a deadlock since systemd is waiting on unattended-upgrades to finish but u-u is waiting on systemd reexec
  - Fix is to not do reexec if systemd is already in the process of stopping

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3825-1/][USN-3825-1]], USN-3825-2] mod_perl vulnerability

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2767][CVE-2011-2767]]
- Old CVE - reported to Debian in 2011, who assigned a CVE internally but didn't go any further with it
- Recently the original reporter of the vulnerability submitted a patch to Debian to fix it - so vuln was reported to Mitre
- Now fixed in Ubuntu as well

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12388][CVE-2018-12388]]
- Firefox update (v63) (Episode 9) had some minor regressions
  - These were present in the upstream firefox release itself
- This provides [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/63.0.3/releasenotes/][63.0.3]] which contains these fixes from upstream to address the regressions
  - WebGL hangs, slow page loading if using specific proxy settings etc.

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
- Large backport of multiple patch series
- Jann Horn (GPZ) reported two issues to Ubuntu regarding systemd
  - possible to inject / alter state across re-execution of systemd itself (since serialized state) - but fails to deserialize it correctly
    - Insecure use of fgets() when parsing long lines
    - Possible root privilege escalation
  - When changing ownership of files in a directory via systemd (useful for executing a systemd unit as a given user for example to ensure files it needs are owned by that user)
    - Would try and handle symlinks specially BUT this is racy (since could change where pointed to during check of symlink and then actual work of chown() after)
    - So for instance, could convince systemd to possible change the ownership of a root owned file to that of another user
    - So could allow to change arbitrary files ownerships or even permissions
- Third issue - older one, systemd-tmpfiles could be used to obtain ownership of arbitrary files
  - Would follow symlinks in non-terminal path components, and then operate on the resulting file
  - Can tell it to set permissions / ownership of given files
  - So could race it to replace path components with symlinks to root-owned files and get it to change their ownership to that of the user (or whomeever)
  - Original patch series (March) didn't completely fix this - required much more invasive patching later
  - We waited to fix it until the complete fix was available and accepted upstream (August) to then start backporting

*** New Intel Side Channel Attacks (again...)
- [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05441.pdf][A Systematic Evaluation of Transient Execution Attacks and Defenses]]
- Reclassifies existing Meltdown and Spectre attacks with a new nomenclature
  - ie. original Meltdown is now Meltdown-US (US = User/Supervisor)
- Identifies a bunch of other possible variants for both Meltdown and Spectre
  - Meltdown-PK - bypass restrictions on Intel memory protection keys
  - Meltdown-BR - Spectre-like attack but using bounds-range exceeded exception to trigger
  - 5 new Spectre variants based on existing ones but targetting different
    microarchitectural elements (ie targetting the Branch Target Buffer when
    doing a Spectre-RSB attack since some processors fallback to BTB when RSB
    is empty)
- Compares existing mitigations for each existing and newly identified attack
- Very comprehensive, demonstrates the utility of such a complete analysis compared to existing approach where different researchers have looked at a single aspect
- Still an active area of research with new vulnerabilities turning up

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16396][CVE-2018-16396]]
- Misuses return value when comparing names in X509 certificates
  - If returned 1 on comparing name would assume are identical but are in fact not
  - Could allow to impersonate a certificate
- Taint flags not propagated when unpacking arrays into strings, or packing strings into arrays
  - Could allow untrusted data to be treated as trusted

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3809-1/][USN-3809-1]]] OpenSSH vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15473][CVE-2018-15473]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-10708][CVE-2016-10708]]

  - Could be triggered on both peer or server side
  - Lack of input validation coupled with an integer overflow lead to crash and possible authentication bypass
  - Leads to memcpy() with a negative length value (and hence very large unsigned value)
  - Theoretically possible to overwrite other data structures related to server state and therefore bypass authentication

*** [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1060][PortSmash]] - New Intel side-channel vulnerability or expected behaviour for SMT?
- [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-5407.html][CVE-2018-5407]] assigned to OpenSSL but described as a side-channel in Intel SMT / Hyper-Threading
  - https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/11/01/4
  - Affects OpenSSL <= 1.1.0h
- [[https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/12/8][Originally suggested as a possible side-channel in 2015]]
- Due to sharing of execution engines in SMT
  - Two processes across shared hyper-threads, contend for execution units across same ports
  - Meaure port contention delay -> side channel to recover ECDSA private key of server running in other process
- So crypto code needs not only to be constant-time, but also secret-independent execution-flow
  - ie. execute same instruction sequence regardless of secret
  - all code and data addresses are assumed public
- Or disable HT / learn to schedule trust domains across different hyper-threads (gang-scheduling)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3802-1/][USN-3802-1]]] X.Org X server vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14665][CVE-2018-14665]]
- Incorrect permissions check for 2 command-line arguments (-modulepath and -logfile)
- On *some* platforms (not Ubuntu) Xorg itself is setuid
- Can then use these command-line options to overwrite arbitrary files etc -> privilege escalation to root via say overwrite of /etc/shadow
- Generated a lot of press - *BUT* missed the distinction that Xorg is not really setuid on Ubuntu
- We use Xorg.wrap as setuid to first run and drop permissions if using KMS driver
  - This is the case for the vast majority of drivers, and for almost all free drivers
  - So most Ubuntu users unaffected by this vulnerability
- Special Friday release :)

- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10933][CVE-2018-10933]]
- Embedded SSH server and client implementation
- Allows bypass of authentication by remote attackers if they send a SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS message instead of the SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message to initiate the authentication process
- This message is meant to be sent from the server to the client but in this case are sending it *to the server*
- State machine on server-side then jumps straight to 'Authenticated'
- Only affects applications which use libssh as a server

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3796-1/][USN-3796-1]], USN-3796-2] Paramiko vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic & Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1000805][CVE-2018-1000805]]
- Python SSH library for both servers and clients
- Very similar to CVE-2018-10933 for libssh - remote authentication bypass by presenting SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS in place of SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
- Due to code-reuse between client and server implementations
- On server side, runs the normal client side code to be used when receiving this authentication success from the server, and flips the 'authenticated' flag - which is shared by both the server and client code

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish Released
- Includes OpenSSL 1.1.1 for TLS 1.3 support
- Support for using fingerprint readers to unlock screen etc

  - libfprint and fprintd promoted to main to allow this
*** Ubuntu CVE Tracker facelift
- Refreshed look and feel via bootstrap
- https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10811][CVE-2018-10811]]
- 2 CVEs: flaws in RSA implementation allow Bleichenbacher-style attacks in parsing of the ASN.1 encoded digestInfo
- strongSwan implementation was too lenient and would allow arbitrary random data to be contained following various elements in the ASN.1
- Also would not check the correct amount of padding had been used
- Allows attackers to potentially forge low-exponent signature forgery and hence authentication during IKE authentication
- 2 CVEs for DoS due to missing length check and missing variable initialization
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3772-1/][USN-3772-1]]] UDisks vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17336][CVE-2018-17336]]
- Format string vulnerability which could be exploited via specially crafted disk label
- udisks prints volume label via printf() passing the label as part of the format string
  - Simple fix to replace the label with a %s directive and then pass the label to that
  - ie. don't interpret label as printf() directives directly

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** LSM Stacking upstreaming
- Casey Schaufler (Intel, SMACK maintainer) primary developer along with John Johansen and Kees Cook (Google) to upstream support for LSM stacking
- Currently upstream allows use of one 'major' module (SELinux / AppArmor / Tomoyo) with a minor module (Yama etc)
- Goal of stacking is to allow multiple major modules to be used in conjunction (AppArmor with SELinux)
  - Primary use-case is containers
- Current stacking patches allow to stack Tomoyo with either SELinux / AppArmor
  - Eventually should be able to stack SELinux with AppArmor but still WIP
  - Ubuntu already carries these patches in Bionic etc
- Likely to be merged in the near future
*** Evince AppArmor hardening [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/1788929][LP #1788929]]
- Jann Horn (GPZ) reported gaps in evince AppArmor profile
- Clever use of GNOME thumbnailer infrastructure to specify a new 'evil' thumbnailer and the use of systemd via DBus to escape AppArmor confinement
- Policy fixed in Cosmic, in process of updating for Bionic etc

- Ghostscript is used to process Postscript (and other formats) - PS is Turing
  Complete so in general is unsafe
- Hence Ghostscript includes a sandbox (-dSAFER) to try and prevent issues with
  handling of untrusted files
- Tavis Ormandy previously found a number of issues in the SAFER sandbox which
  allowed escape from it and execution of commands (ie. CVE-2016-7977 etc.)
- Recently discovered more - including ability to execute arbitrary code.

- Transport Independent RPC Library, used by NFS
- 1 medium priority issue:
  - Crash from NULL pointer dereference when run out of file descriptions (failure to check return value) - a remote attacker could cause crash by flooding with new connections
- 2 low priority issues:
  - "rpcbomb" - allows an unauthenticated attacker to DoS via memory exhaustion
  - Stack based buffer overflow could cause a crash when flooded by ICMP and UDP packets in the sunrpc implementation - fixed by replacing stack based memory allocation with heap-based allocation instead
  - Common pattern to fix this type of issue - similar work in Linux kernel recently by KSPP to replace VLAs

- Latest firefox release (62) fixing a number of issues including DoS and RCE
- One interesting one is CVE-2018-12383 - in Firefox 58 the password storage
  format was changed (was sqlite, then was changed to json). When user sets a
  master password, this is used to encrypt all stored passwords. However, this
  was only done for the copy stored with the new format - the old copy would
  still be stored unencrypted since it never had a master password set on
  it. This is now fixed to simply delete the old copy of the password DB.

*** Discussions around hardening guides for Ubuntu
- A number of 'best practices' guides exist for hardening Ubuntu installations from reputable organisations
  - [[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-ubuntu-1804-lts][NCSC]]
  - [[https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux/][CIS Benchmarks]]
  - many others
- In general these have similar recommendations:
  - Use UEFI Secure Boot
  - Disable unnecesary services
  - Use a known and fixed networking configuration (disable DHCP / use VPN etc)
  - Enable Mandatory Access Control frameworks (ie. AppArmor)
  - Use a specific password policy
  - Enable auditing
- Differ in level of detail and technical knowledge needed to deploy
- Typically aimed at computer and network administrators (not end-users)
- Ubuntu already includes a number of these recommendations out of the box:
  - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features
- Ubuntu strives to strike a balance between security and usability out-of-the-box

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** MIR Process and bubblewrap
- Security team is responsible for doing security audits of packages which are proposed to be included in the main section of the Ubuntu package repository
  - Packages in main are officially maintained, supported and recommended so deserve a high level of scrutiny before promotion into main
  - Security team historically only provides security updates to packages in main as well
  - So we have to be confident we can maintain and support a given package
- To perform the security review we look at a number of things:
  - The code is evaluated to determine how easy or not it would be to maintain
  - The package itself is evaluated to look for potential issues
  - Code is then evaluated to look for potential existing security vulnerabilities
- This can be a time consuming process, especially to do well
- Recently this was in the news, when Hanno Böck (infosec journalist and
  researcher) and Tavis Ormandy (GPZ) raised the issue of lack of bubblewrap
  support for gnome desktop thumbnailers
  - bubblewrap provides support for sandboxing processes via namespaces and the
    use of it to sandbox desktop thumbnailers was introduced in the GNOME 3.26
    release
  - It was planned to be supported for Ubuntu 18.04, but to do this the package
    had to be moved from universe into main, hence a MIR
  - Due to shifting priorities, the security team was not able to get this done
    in time and hence the feature had to be disabled
  - This MIR is being proritised now so this security hardening feature should be available in an upcoming release
  - Security team is also looking at how to strengthen the hardening via AppArmor MAC profiles in addition
  - Thanks to Hanno and Tavis for giving this greater visibility

L1TF kernel regressions, WPA2 key recovery, mirror fail and more!
#+end_description
** Overview
83 unique CVEs addressed across the supported Ubuntu releases.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-3/][USN-3742-3]]] Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) regressions
- Security team issues USNs for package updates caused by regressions in previous security updates
- Fix for regressions caused by the original kernel update for L1TF
- Could cause Java applications to fail to start and possible kernel panics on
  boot for some hardware configurations
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3745-1/][USN-3745-1]]] wpa_supplicant and hostapd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14526][CVE-2018-14526]]
- Researchers analysed WPA2 4-way handshake via symbolic execution to find weaknesses
  - Found a number of issues including a decryption oracle
  - In this case, the would decrypt but not authenticate frame and then could allow recovery of the group key via a timing side-channel
  - In theory, allows an unauthenticated attacker to recover WPA2 group key via frame manipulation when used with TKIP
    - NOTE: is not advised to use TKIP in practice anyway (should use WPA2/CCMP) and so should have limited applicability
  - In practice, due to large number of attempts needed to recover the full key, this is impractical (especially given that the group key is changed periodically)

- https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/woot2018.pdf
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3746-1/][USN-3746-1]]] APT vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-0501][CVE-2018-0501]]
- Dubbed "mirror fail" by the author and even a website - https://mirror.fail/
- mirror protocol in apt allows to specify a list of mirrors to try rather than just a single mirror in source.list
  - not enabled by default
- in APT 1.6 this was reworked and a bug introduced
  - on fallback from one mirror to the next, the previous mirrors InRelease file would be used without checking the one from the new mirror
  - hence failing to authenticate the one from the new mirror
  - could potentially allow installation of untrusted packages BUT would need at least two mirrors to be compromised AND for the user to have setup use of multiple mirrors in the first place
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3748-1/][USN-3748-1]]] base-files vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6557][CVE-2018-6557]]
- Vulnerability in the motd update script via insecure use of temporary files

*** L1TF and FragmentSmack vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-1/][USN-3740-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-2/][USN-3740-2]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-1/][USN-3741-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-2/][USN-3741-2]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-1/][USN-3742-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-2/][USN-3742-2]])
**** L1TF ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3620][CVE-2018-3620]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3646][CVE-2018-3646]])
- Latest speculative execution cache side channel attack affecting Intel processors
- Allows to access contents from L1 Data Cache via speculative execution,  can then be read by cache side channel
- 3 variants, SGX, SMM and VMM but only 2 affect Ubuntu
- Processors access virtual addresses which need to be translated to physical addresses
- Page Table Entries map from one to the other (contains metadata of page including offset and present bit)
- Pages can be swapped in our out of memory (Present or not) - so if not present then need to do a full page table walk to look up physical address
- But Intel processor will use offset value from PTE even on non-present pages *speculatively*
- For non-present pages, this value is usually junk so can essentially speculatively read arbitrary memory from L1D cache depending on PTE value
- SGX doesn't affect Ubuntu since not used
- SMM fixed via ensuring PTEs of not present pages always refer to non-cacheable memory and hence can't be used for this
- VMM is trickier
  - VMs maintain their own PTEs so also need to ensure they are doing the right thing
  - OR if running untrusted VMs need to do a full L1D flush on switching from host to VM
- Made more trickier by Hyper Threading since sibling hyper-threads share the L1D cache
- So if have different trust domains on sibling hyper-threads may have to disable HT in certain circumstances
**** FragmentSmack ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5391][CVE-2018-5391]])
- Last week was SegmentSmack in TCP fragment reassembly, this week is FragmentSmack
- Similar but for IP fragmentation reassembly
  - Exploiting high algorithmic complexity of IP fragment reassembly code paths to cause DoS
*** GnuPG ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3733-2/][USN-3733-2]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7526][CVE-2017-7526]])
- Last week GnuPG was fixed for Xenial and Trusty for RSA cache side-channel issue

*** Seth Arnold's AppArmor 3.0 presentation at DebConf
- Overview of AppArmor with brief history and walkthough of main features
- Efforts to enable AppArmor by default in Debian Buster (10)
- Ongoing work to upstream the latest AppArmor changes
  - Course-grained network mediation (AF_INET / AF_IET6)
  - DBus mediation
    - Almost all are now in Linux kernel 4.19
  - Some remain for 4.20
    - Unix sockets
- Future directions for AppArmor
  - IMA-aware policy (in 4.17, requires AppArmor 3.0 userspace)
    - Contributed by Google, hopefully will be available soon
  - Fine-grained networking mediation (ie. port level mediation)
  - Shared memory mediation
  - cgroups
  - overlayfs
  - user specific policy
- Multiple namespaces support for AppArmor
  - LXD / libvirt / snapd / docker
  - policy within a namespace (and policy outside the namespace too)
- Demo of LXD with namespaced policy
- https://debconf18.debconf.org/talks/106-apparmor-30/
