# Ubuntu Security Podcast

Ubuntu Security Podcast is a weekly podcast by the Ubuntu Security Team,
focussing on the latest updates from the team with a discussion of some of the
more interesting vulnerabilities fixed in the last week, as well as other news
and details from the community.

## Website

The website is hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) from an Emacs
[org-mode](https://orgmode.org/)
[document](https://github.com/alexmurray/ubuntu-security-podcast/blob/master/org/episodes.org)
via the [ox-hugo](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo) package. The [theme](https://github.com/alexmurray/castanet) is
a slightly customised version of
[castanet](https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet) to support the standard
Ubuntu / Canonical colours etc.

## Show notes

To assist in generating show notes, there is an [Emacs Lisp
script](https://github.com/alexmurray/ubuntu-security-podcast/blob/master/org/ubuntu-security-podcast.el)
to auto-generate the boiler plate for a new episode using emails (queried via
[mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html)) to the
[ubuntu-security-announce](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce)
mailing list. This automatically lists each Ubuntu Security Notice (USN) which
was published during the selected time period along with the unique CVEs
mentioned in the USNs, and finally collates the total number of unique CVEs
mentioned in the episode.

Some manual rework is needed to reduce the overall length of the generated show
notes to collate package updates for packages which cover the same CVEs and to
then add details of each of the CVEs.
