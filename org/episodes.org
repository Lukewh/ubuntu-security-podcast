  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18218][CVE-2019-18218]] <!--- medium --->
- OSS-Fuzz using libFuzzer - heap based buffer overflow of up to 4 bytes in
  the CDF parser when handing vector elements - Composite Document File -
  used in MS Office prior to new zipped XML format - ie. the old .doc /
  .xls etc

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4173-1/][USN-4173-1]]] FreeTDS vulnerability [01:48]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Disco, Eoan
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13508][CVE-2019-13508]] <!--- medium --->
- Felix Wilhelm for Google Security Team - if a server were to downgrade
  the protocol to version 5 and send a UDT type to the client, would cause
  a heap buffer overflow due to mismatch in size - fixed by forcing the
  size to an appropriate value

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4170-2/][USN-4170-2]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4170-3/][USN-4170-3]]] Whoopsie regressions [02:22]
- Affecting Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-51/][Episode 51]] - update caused crash on upload to server due to mismatch in
  size and resulting partial uninitialized variable - fixed to intialize
  but realised this could still potentially crash on big-endian
  architectures so fixed properly by changing size to 32-bit to match
  memcpy()

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4171-3/][USN-4171-3]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4171-4/][USN-4171-4]]] Apport regression [04:07]

- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-51/][Episode 51]] - regression due to missing change to python code to handle
  new internal API - fixed by updating the API to be backwards compatible

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4174-1/][USN-4174-1]]] HAproxy vulnerability [04:55]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18277][CVE-2019-18277]] <!--- medium --->
- HTTP Request Smuggling attack
  - https://nathandavison.com/blog/haproxy-http-request-smuggling
- Wouldn't reject messages that specified transfer-encoding without
  "chunked" value
- Could be combined with http reuse for request smuggling - ie. the ability
  to get an attacker controlled chunk appended to a legitimate request and
  hence the response sent back to the attacker etc - fixed to reject if
  transfer-encoding is used without also specifying "chunked"

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4175-1/][USN-4175-1]]] Nokogiri vulnerability [06:36]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-5477][CVE-2019-5477]] <!--- medium --->
- Ruby based parser for HTML/XML/SAS etc with XPath & CSS selector support
  etc
- Command-injection vulnerability - due to use of the Rexical gem - and
  would need to have code which then calls the undocumented load_file
  method within the CSS tokenizer with user supplied input for the
  filename - due to use of eval()...

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4165-2/][USN-4165-2]]] Firefox regressions [07:38]
- Affecting Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
- Upstream Firefox 70.0.1 release to fix a regression in the 70.0 release
  (some pages with dynamic javascript would fail to load - v 70.0 had
  enabled a new next-gen local storage feature which caused issues so this
  is now disabled by default)

  - Heap buffer overflow via a crafted WebRTC video - originally for
    Chromium and was fixed for that last year - Firefox suffered similarly
    but disables the feature by default - has finally been fixed for
    Firefox as well by integrating the original fix from Chromium
  - Usual suspects of stack-based buffer overflows, UAFs, a heap buffer
    overflow in bundled expat ([[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-47/][Episode 47]]),

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4166-1/][USN-4166-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4166-2/][USN-4166-2]]] PHP vulnerability [02:10]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11043][CVE-2019-11043]] <!--- medium --->
- RCE in PHP (FPM - FastCGI Process Manager) - possible to cause the FPM
  module to write past allocated buffers - and so ends up also writing into the FCGI
  protocol data buffers - which can then create a chance for RCE
- Exploit on github targetting vulnerable PHP-FPM servers which use nginx
  in a particular configuration

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4167-1/][USN-4167-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4167-2/][USN-4167-2]]] Samba vulnerabilities [03:11]
- 3 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10218][CVE-2019-10218]] <!--- medium --->
- DoS from a user with "get changes" permissions - could crash an AD DC
  LDAP server due to a NULL pointer deref when using dirsync with ranged results
- Can configure AD DC to call out to a custom command to verify password
  complexity - is handed a copy of the cleartext password - but if this
  contained any multi-byte characters, would not get the full password -
  since it would pass the password as bytes but only copy the number of
  characters - and since multi-byte characters take more than 1 byte would
  miss the last few bytes of the password - so could circumvent password
  complexity requirements
- Malicious server could craft filenames which contain relative path
  characters (../ etc) which would then cause an SMB client to access local
  files for reading / writing rather than remote files - so a remote server
  could cause a client to create files outside the working directory on the
  local machine

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4168-1/][USN-4168-1]]] Libidn2 vulnerabilities [05:15]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12290][CVE-2019-12290]] <!--- medium --->
- Library for handling internationalised domain names
- Heap based buffer overflow via a too-long domain name (greater than 63
  characters - in library, caller passes a buffer that is specified to be a
  minimum of 64 bytes - but libidn strcpy()'s into it so could easily overflow.
- Possible domain name impersonation since doesn't bother to check unicode
  conversions - so could use punycode (ascii representation of certain
  unicode characters) to impersonate a unicode domain

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4169-1/][USN-4169-1]]] libarchive vulnerability [06:32]

  - reads /proc/PID files as root - so if can race on process ID reuse
    could cause Apport to generate a crash dump of a privileged process
    that is readable by a normal user (so starts dumping an unprivileged
    process, then PID race, new PID as privileged user -> this crashes ->
    Apport starts writing out the crash report for the first process but
    using the details of the new privileged process - since this was
    originally an unprivileged process, the crash dump is then unprivileged
    too). Fixed by making sure Apport drops privileges to the original
    unprivileged user before reading /proc/PID info so if this happens to
    then be a different user's process will not be able to generate the
    crash dump
  - Apport would read a per-user configuration file - but would do so as
    root - and so this could be a symlink to a root owned file and Apport
    would happily read it (but might error out if it looked invalid) - so
    drop privileges to read it so it doesn't include anything which it
    shouldn't in the final crash report

- Sander Bos
  - Apport had a lock file in a world-writable directory - so anyone could
    create it to either stop Apport running or to control the execution of
    Apport over time - fixed to place in a non-world writable location
    instead
  - When using containers, Apport uses a socket file to allow it to forward
    crash dumps that it captured on the host to an Apport instance running
    within a container containers - it finds the socket file from the host
    using the /proc/PID/root magic link - but this could allow an
    unprivileged user who (using unprivileged usernamespaces) is root in a
    container to chroot() for a process in a container to a different
    location so it can then intercept the crash dump of a privileged
    process within the container - so could run a setuid process in the
    container, and when it crashes be able to read it's crash dump
  - TOCCTOU race on PID (like above) but this is in a different code path -
    reads the cwd of the crashed process to write out the core dump to this
    location - but on process ID reuse this could then be in a different
    location - so if a user can race against a privileged process dumping
    the crash dump could end up in a location of their choosing

- University of Washington IMAP toolkit (used by PHP for it's IMAP implementation)
- Used rsh to implement various operations - wouldn't try and sanitize the

  - possible heap buffer overflow as a result of a dangling pointer - so
    same memory area could be reused for future memory operations -> fixed
    to reset the pointer when done
  - 2 low priority issues - both stack memory info disclosures

- Integer overflow -> buffer overflow -> root privesc in binder
- Reintroduction of Spectre v1 vulnerability in ptrace subsystem - Brad
  Spengler - fixed properly in Linus' tree but not when it got backported
  to the stable tree - two lines of code got reordered - so load of
  possible speculative value occurred _after_it had been used - so the
  speculative load barrier had no effect - Ubuntu regularly backports fixes
  from the latest stable tree so we ended up affected as well
  - https://grsecurity.net/teardown_of_a_failed_linux_lts_spectre_fix.php
- Possible DoS (kernel crash) if users can write to /dev/kvm - by default
  on Ubuntu users don't have this privilege so generally not affected
- 2 different heap based buffer overflows in Marvell Wifi driver ->
  occurred when setting parameters for the driver so could be triggered by
  a local users -> crash, DoS or
  possible code execution

- Lots of press around a seemingly high priority privilege escalation
  vulnerability - BUT requires an admin to have configured sudo with a
  particular configuration (ie specifying a user can run a command as any
  other user via the ALL keyword in a Runas rule). In this case if the rule
  had also been configured to explicitly deny running the command as root,
  this could be bypassed by the user specifying a UID of -1. So would only
  affect a very small number of installations.

- OOB read in ath6kl driver - possible to trigger remotely from the network - crash, DoS
- Bluetooth KNOB attack
- Crashes from malicious USB audio devices:
  - Infinite recursion when parsing device descriptors (if
    had multiple identical device descriptors could be triggered)
  - OOB read if specified an invalid input pin
- OOB read in QLogic QEDI iSCSI driver
- 2 covered in [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-46/][Episode 46]]
  - Possible code execution via a NULL pointer dereference in bluetooth UART
    driver - so if an attacker can map executable code at address zero can
    achieve code execution - in Ubuntu we have mmap_min_addr set to a
    non-zero value so this is mitigated by default
  - DoS in Intel wifi driver - allows a malicious client to knock a peer of
    the network

    for wrong host
    - Fixed incorrectly upstream so had a two CVEs assigned
- http cookiejar wouldn't validate URL correctly so could also send cookies
  for another domain
- Possible NULL ptr deref when parsing X509 certs if had an empty CRL
  distpoint / URI

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4124-1/][USN-4124-1]]] Exim vulnerability [00:49]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-15846][CVE-2019-15846]] <!--- high --->
    - When doing TLS negotiation, parses the Server Name Indication
      headers - would try and handle escape sequences in this string.
    - Does so by looking at the character after a backslash to determine
      what escape sequence is (\b etc) and then returns that actual value
      (in string_interpret_escape())
    - This gets called by the function string_unprinting() which is used to
      translate escaped characters into their proper form in a new string -
      and this will run over the bounds of the original string if it ends
      with a backslash - since string_interpret_escape() would assume there
      was contents afterwards to interpret
    - Qualsys were able to develop a PoC which leverages this OOB behaviour
      into a remote root exploit (since this part of the code runs as root
      and they were able to use a combination of heap corruption and OOB
      writes to get code execution)
    - Fixed to first check if reached end of string (NUL) before trying to
      handle the escaped character
  - Able to be mitigated by setting ACLs to deny connections which contain
    a trailing backslash in the SNI field - see [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-15846][CVE-2019-15846 in the Ubuntu CVE Tracker]]

    - Kernel tries to randomise IP ID values (used for de-fragmentation of
      IP packets) for connection-less protocols to avoid tracking
    - Is meant to be random across source + dest address + protocol
    - But if an attacker can observe traffic to multiple hosts, can infer
      the hashing key used to generate the ID values
    - And then can associate different streams of packets back to the same
      source host and hence can track devices
    - Fixed to used an actual random value for the base of the hash and use
      a better hashing algorithm (siphash) for ID generation

** Overview
This week we look at security updates for Dovecot, Ghostscript, a livepatch update for the Linux kernel, Ceph and Apache, plus Alex and Joe discuss recent Wordpress plugin vulnerabilities and the Hostinger breach, and more.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
22 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4110-1/][USN-4110-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4110-2/][USN-4110-2]]] Dovecot vulnerability [00:52]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11500][CVE-2019-11500]]
- IMAP and ManageSieve protocol parsers would not check for embedded NUL bytes in strings
  - When parsing these strings, would return indexes outside the normal
    string bounds as the first character which needed unescaping
  - Would then go and try to unescape the string from this index, which
    rewrites the string on the fly, and so would then go and rewrite
    outside the bounds of the string
  - Fixed to disallow embedded NUL bytes AND to not try and skip up to
    first unescaped character but instead loop over the whole string in
    unescaping

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4110-3/][USN-4110-3]], USN-4110-4] Dovecot regression [02:08]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11500][CVE-2019-11500]]
- Original patch used pre-release version of the fix from upstream which
  contained an error such that the checking of NUL bytes was skipped -
  re-released with correct final upstream fix

*** [[[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2019-August/005085.html][LSN-0054-1]]] Linux kernel vulnerability [02:38]

- Livepatch for CVEs addressed in regular kernel updates ([[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-43/][Episode 43]])
  - ptrace credentials race, Marvell Wifi heap-buffer overflows, NULL
    pointer dereferences

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4111-1/][USN-4111-1]]] Ghostscript vulnerabilities [03:20]
- 4 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14817][CVE-2019-14817]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14811][CVE-2019-14811]]
- Four more -dSAFER sandbox bypasses (see [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-43/][Episode 43]] for the last one)
- All variations on the theme of using the .forceput operator to escape the
  sandbox

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4112-1/][USN-4112-1]]] Ceph vulnerability [04:01]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10222][CVE-2019-10222]]
- DoS - unauthenticated clients can crash the rados gateway by
  disconnecting at certain time (triggering a NULL pointer deference when
  looking up the remote address for a connected client)
  - Older versions are not affected since this is in the beast RGW
    frontend - which is not in the versions in trusty / xenial - and only
    in the bionic version as an experimental feature

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4113-1/][USN-4113-1]]] Apache HTTP Server vulnerabilities [04:41]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-0197][CVE-2019-0197]]

- HTTP/2 DoS issue (Internal Data Buffering) - [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-43/][Episode 43]] for nginx
  - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/http2
- Open redirect in mod_rewrite if have self-referential redirects
- Stack buffer overflow + NULL pointer dereference in mod_remoteip
- Possible XSS in mod_proxy where the link shown on error pages could be
  controlled by an attacker - but only possible where configured with
  proxying enable but misconfigured so that Proxy Error page is shown.
- UAF (read) during HTTP/2 connection shutdown
- HTTP/2 push - allows server to send resources to a client before it
  requests them - could overwrite memory of the server's request pool -
  this is preconfigured and not under control of client but could cause a
  crash etc.
- HTTP/2 upgrade - can configure to automatically upgrade HTTP/1.1 requests
  to HTTP/2 - but if this was not the first request on the connection could
  lead to crash

** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
21 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4100-1/][USN-4100-1]]] KConfig and KDE libraries vulnerabilities [00:46]
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6232][CVE-2016-6232]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14744][CVE-2019-14744]]
- Directory traversal in KArchive via ../
- RCE via malicious .desktop file - contianed extra functionality outside
  of XDG spec, where could contain shell commands that would get expanded -
  so if you view a .desktop file in Dolphin, and the Icon property
  contained shell commands, this would get evaluated - so wouldn't need to
  interact at all - upstream now removed this 'feature'

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4102-1/][USN-4102-1]]] LibreOffice vulnerabilities [02:45]
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9852][CVE-2019-9852]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9851][CVE-2019-9851]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9850][CVE-2019-9850]]
- Docs can have macros & scripts on action - document-open, mouse-over
  - Should only be for scripts shipped in libreoffice itself
  - Path bypass in CVE-2018-16858 - so added more protections
  - Could be bypassed again with URL encoding - so fix again
- Second LibreLogo issue ([[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-40/][Episode 40]]) - could bypass previous protections
  again - was fixed upstream but found to still be inadequate - hence 2
  CVEs for this (incomplete fix the first time around)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-2/][USN-4078-2]]] OpenLDAP vulnerabilities [04:26]
- 2 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13565][CVE-2019-13565]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13057][CVE-2019-13057]]
- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-41/][Episode 41]] for regular releases - now ESM as well

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4103-1/][USN-4103-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4103-2/][USN-4103-2]]] docker-credential-helpers and Docker vulnerabilities [04:52]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Disco (docker-credential-helpers)
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco (docker)
  - [[HTTPS://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-1020014][CVE-2019-1020014]]
- golang-docker-credentials package had a double-free which could be
  triggered via a local user -> crash, DoS
- Bundled with docker.io package so update both

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4104-1/][USN-4104-1]]] Nova vulnerability [05:28]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14433][CVE-2019-14433]]
- API requests which end in fault conditions from authenticated users could
  result in keys or other details being leaked / returned in responses to
  further API requests (not just any error / fault but say if tried to
  hard-reboot and this fails) - fixed to sanitize any possible details out
  of faults

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4105-1/][USN-4105-1]]] CUPS vulnerabilities [06:30]
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-8675][CVE-2019-8675]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-8696][CVE-2019-8696]]
- SNMP backend - parses ASN.1 encoded data - can be used to automatically
  get status from printers etc - would not do bounds checking on actual
  encoded ASN.1 data vs the description of it - so could easily get a stack
  buffer overflow - fixed to add bounds checking
- Also includes some other upstream fixes for potential security issues
  (without CVEs), including a CPU based DoS if a cups client unexpectedly
  disconnected

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4106-1/][USN-4106-1]]] NLTK vulnerability [07:37]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14751][CVE-2019-14751]]
- Python Natural Language Toolkit - downloads datasets as ZIP compressed
- Mike Salvatore - ZipSlip
- https://salvatoresecurity.com/zip-slip-in-nltk-cve-2019-14751/
- Fixed to use inbuilt python zipfile handling to unzip rather than custom
  implementation

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4107-1/][USN-4107-1]]] GIFLIB vulnerabilities [08:35]
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-15133][CVE-2019-15133]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-11490][CVE-2018-11490]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3977][CVE-2016-3977]]
- Common library used for handling GIF images (openjdk, ffmpeg, gstreamer, kde)
- Divide-by-zero
- 2 different heap based buffer overflows - one was originally fixed in
  Debian but the patch for it got dropped in a later release - so we have
  repatched that

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4108-1/][USN-4108-1]]] Zstandard vulnerability [09:20]
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11922][CVE-2019-11922]]
- Common library (maintained by Facebook) for handling the zstd compression algorithm
- Race condition when using single-pass compression, might allow attacker
  to get OOB write IF the caller had provided a smaller output buffer than
  the recommended size
- So likely won't affect all packages which use zstd (there are many) -
  should always follow best practice

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4109-1/][USN-4109-1]]] OpenJPEG vulnerabilities [10:11]
- 5 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6616][CVE-2018-6616]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-17480][CVE-2017-17480]]
- 4 different DoS issues:
  - 2 in BMP handling:
    - CPU based DoS due to inefficient algorithm implementation
    - Integer overflow -> OOB read -> DoS
  - NULL pointer dereference when converting to PNM
  - Divide by zero
- Stack based buffer overflow when handling JP3D encoded data - OOB write -
  DoS / RCE

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10126][CVE-2019-10126]]
- Latest speculative execution side-channel attack - SWAPGS
  - https://www.bitdefender.com/business/swapgs-attack.html
  - Userspace can speculatively execute SWAPGS, allowing it to potentially
    read kernel memory by speculatively swapping out userspace for kernel
    memory - requires an appropriate gadget in the kernel
  - Linux not believed to be affected, since no appropriate gadget is
    available, however we have proactively included the upstream fix which
    is to add LFENCE calls around SWAPGS to ensure SWAPGS occurs before any
    subsequent memory reads to / from userspace
- 2 different memory corruption issues in the Marvell Wifi driver -
  wouldn't do bounds checking on structures passed to it from user-space -
  could allow DoS via crash or RCE
- NULL ptr dereferences:
  - NFC subsystem, able to be triggered from userspace (using netlink)
  - PowerPC specific - could occur on memory allocation failures (failed to
    check NULL return value)
- 2 by Jann Horn:
  - ptrace would record process credentials incorrectly, so that a local user
    can escalate to root in scenarios where a parent process drops privileges
    and then calls execve of an attacker controlled application
  - UAF in handling of local descriptor table entries

- 2 information disclosure vulnerabilities:
  - Exposes kernel memory to user-space which could expose sensitive
    information (keys, pointers to help defeat ASLR etc)
  - Bluetooth Human Interface Device Protocol (HIDP) socket ioctl() failed
    to NUL terminate the name field
  - Ext4 file-system did not zero out unused regions in extents tree blocks
    which are returned to user-space
- Use-after-free due to a race-condition in the reliable datagram socket
    (RDS) protocol module -> crash / code exec
  - Blacklisted by default in Ubuntu and contrary to the original CVE
    description, this is not likely to be remotely exploitable since the
    use-after-free only occurs on namespace cleanup
- Intel i915 graphics driver failed to validate ranges for mmap() in some places
  - Local attacker who already has access to the device could use this to
    crash / code execution -> privilege escalation

- Freescale Hypervisor Manager (HVM) for PowerPC - used invalid size
  parameter from ioctl() for page size calculations - local attacker could
  use this to cause various memory corruption issues possibly resulting in
  privilege escalation or code execution (only enabled in Xenial 4.4
  kernel)
- Broadcom wifi driver would possibly pass through firmware events received
  on-the-air to the local USB wifi device - allows a remote attacker to
  send firmware events to the device having unspecified impact
- Possible seccomp bypass for policies that use ptrace on ARM - a tracing
  process could modify a syscall parameter after the seccomp decision for
  that syscall had been made - so could violate the policy
- Bluetooth HIDP + Ext4 extents information disclosure vulns covered earlier
- Race condition in Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) could possibly result in a
  UAF -> crash, or code execution

- All related - in each case various libvirt APIs were accessible to users
  with read-only permissions and allowed them to perform operations which
  they should not have access to - in one case providing an ability to
  escalate privileges to root on the host - since would allow to execute
  arbitrary binaries with elevated permissions.
- By default, libvirt is constrained by AppArmor in Ubuntu which provides
  some isolation to help in these cases

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15664][CVE-2018-15664]]
- Directory traversal via crafted symlink exchange (TOCTOU) via docker cp
  command - docker cp can be used to copy files between host and
  container - to do this safely, need to resolve paths as though were in
  the container - so tries to check a path by resolving symlinks, and then
  later use it if validates - but race exists where can then modify a
  component in the path via symlink *after* the check but *before* the
  copy, so can then overwrite arbitrary files on the host -> privilege
  escalation
- runc component in docker could allow a container to overwrite the runc
  binary on the host -> privilege escalation (and container escape) to the
  runc context on the host

- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13012][CVE-2019-13012]]
- Similar to [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12450][CVE-2019-12450]] ([[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-36/][Episode 36]]) - in this case, directories and
  files would get created with default permisssions, not restrictive
  permissions, when using the keyfile gsettings backend - could expose
  settings or allow other users to modify settings etc.

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4051-1/][USN-4051-1]], USN-4051-2] Apport vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7307][CVE-2019-7307]]
- Reported by Kevin Backhouse of Semmle Security Research Team
- TOCTOU when processing a users own ignore configuration file
- Apport runs as root, but would check permission to file via access()
  system call - which uses the real processes' UID / GID - so is safe as a
  permission check - BUT would then go and open the file - so in the
  meantime this could be replaced by a symlink to say a root owned file
  which could then get included in the resulting crash report
- Fix is to seteuid() as the desired user to set effective UID to then
  actually open the file before restoring euid to root - so this does both
  the equivalent of the access and open in 1 call avoiding to TOCTOU

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4052-1/][USN-4052-1]]] Whoopsie vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11476][CVE-2019-11476]]
- Reported by Kevin Backhouse of Semmle Security Research Team
- Integer overflow when processing crash dump - when parsing the crash
  dump, if it contained an artificially large value in the dump file, would
  overflow length calculation, then would result in a heap-buffer OOB write
  -> crash, DoS OR code-execution as whoopsie process.
- When coupled with previous Apport bug could allow an arbitrary user to
  read any file on the system by first embedding it in a crash dump via
  Apport and then triggering Whoopsie to process it and expose the via
  arbitrary code execution

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12447][CVE-2019-12447]]
- gvfs private server socket did not configure any authorisation - so any
  user could possible connect to it and issue API calls -> possible code
  exection as another user
- files created / moved by admin backend could end up with wrong file
  ownership - admin backend allows to access root files as normal user (via
  admin authorisation) - so can copy files as a user to root's home which
  then are still owned by the original user

7 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4043-1/][USN-4043-1]]] Django vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12781][CVE-2019-12781]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12308][CVE-2019-12308]]
- If using django via a reverse proxy, which itself would connect to django
  over HTTPS, if accessing HTTP resources they would not be redirected to
  HTTPS even if configured to do so on the django server.
- XSS via the 'Current URL' link as this was not validated as a safe URL
  before display - so possible to inject javascript etc via a URL query
  payload parameter etc - such that when the user clicks the link it would
  be executed (RCE bug with user interaction)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4045-1/][USN-4045-1]]] Thunderbird vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11707][CVE-2019-11707]]
- Latest upstream 60.7.2 release
- Mentioned in the context of Firefox in [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-37/][Episode 37]] and [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-38/][Episode 38]] (sandbox
  escape and RCE)
- By default scripting is disabled in TB so not as high an impact

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4044-1/][USN-4044-1]]] ZNC vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12816][CVE-2019-12816]]
- ZNC provides support for plugin modules
- These can be loaded by autenticated, non-admin users
i  - The name of this is checked in various places to ensure control
    characters and other means of code execution are blocked, but not on
    all code-paths using modules
- Would allow to execute code as the ZNC server via an authenticated user
- Fixed to validate module name on all code paths which use it

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4038-3/][USN-4038-3]], USN-4038-4] bzip2 regression
- Affecting Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-38/][Episode 38]] mentioned bzip2 update - we also mentioned this breaks
  decompression of some archives built by lbzip2 etc - this regression
  fixes that by introducing a new patch proposed by upstream to accept as
  many selectors as specified by to then discard them later

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4046-1/][USN-4046-1]]] Irssi vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13045][CVE-2019-13045]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-7054][CVE-2018-7054]]
- 2 different UAF's due to mismanagement of data structures:
  - One on SASL code-paths - so only affected if using SASL
    authentication - would reuse provided username and password
    fields after they had been freed
  - Another in code to handle netsplits (used to handle when servers get
    disconnected from the wider network)
    - This was due to an incomplete fix for previous CVE-2017-7191

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish) reaches End of Life on July 18 2019
- Released October 18, 2018 - non-LTS so 9 months of support
- Past 9 months - no new updates/ security fixes and hence no USNs
- Upgrade to Disco (19.04)
- https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2019-July/004996.html

*** CanonicalLtd GitHub organisation account compromise
- A single account which was part of the CanonicalLtd GitHub organisation
  was compromised 6th July
- Used to create proof-of-concept repositories and issues to demonstrate
  the hack was possible
- Investigation is still on-going but at this stage it only appears to be
  these actions, not malicious but attention seeking in nature
  - No code has been altered or PII accessed (nor is any PII stored there)
- Account has been removed from the CanonicaLtd organisation, investigation
  is still on-going, we will release more details as they become available
- https://twitter.com/ubuntu_sec/status/1147675201632473088

*** SKS keyserver certificate spamming
- https://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f
- WoT aspect of PGP allows users to sign one-anothers public keys
  (certificates) and upload these signatures to the keyservers
- SKS keyservers were designed to never delete anything and instead to append
- So when downloading a key (certificate) you get it plus all the signatures
- SKS supports up to 150k sigs - GnuPG is logarithmic in order of signatures
- So can DoS local GnuPG once have downloaded someones key (cert)
- Re Ubuntu:
  - We use GPG for signing the hashes of packages in the repo
  - This public key is distributed directly inside Ubuntu on install media
    and in the archive and does not depend on the SKS keyserver network
  - Keys for PPAs are fetched from Launchpad, not SKS as well in general
  - So only exposure for Ubuntu users is if manually fetching keys from SKS
    keyservers or if using Enigmail in ThunderBird or other software which
    automatically fetches certs from SKS
- Mitigation
  - if using Enigmail, [[https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/user-manual/handbook-faq][disable auto-fetching / refreshing of public keys]]
  - if using GnuPG directly, don't use SKS keyservers, instead use [[https://keys.openpgp.org][new
    resistant keyserver]]

** Overview
This week we look at the latest security updates for the Linux kernel, Firefox, ImageMagick, OpenStack and more, plus we have a special guest, the maintainer and lead developer of the AppArmor project, John Johansen, to talk about the project and some of the upcoming features.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
55 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4031-1/][USN-4031-1]]] Linux kernel vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12817][CVE-2019-12817]]
- 64-bit PowerPC (ppc64el) memory management issue - introduced in the 4.17
  kernel - so only affects Cosmic/Disco or Bionic when using the HWE kernel
- Different processes might be able to read / write to each others virtual
  memory
  - Requirements:
    - Must be using the hash page table MMU - eg. PowerPC 970 (G5), PA6T,
      Power5/6/7/8/9
      - By default Power9 bare-metal use the Radix MMU so are not affected
        unless have explicitly disabled this via the kernel command-line
      - KVM guests would also be affected in this case or if also
        explicitly configured to use the HPT MMU
      - Logical partitions (LPARs) under PowerVM on Power9 would be
        affected as they always use HPT MMU
    - Need to allocate memory above 512TB - only possible via mmap()
    - Any child process (fork()) receives same context-id for the memory
      mapping so can just read/write to the mappings above 512TB
    - If child exits, a 3rd process could be reallocated the same
      context-id and so could then read/write also
- Only a subset of PowerPC systems will be affected by this and would need
  to be running applications which allocate above 512TB so whilst is high
  impact, low probability of being at risk

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4032-1/][USN-4032-1]]] Firefox vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11708][CVE-2019-11708]]
- Firefox 67.0.4 - latest upstream release
- Possible for a sandboxed child process to escape the sandbox by using IPC
  to send a Prompt:Open message to the parent which would then process
  web-content on behalf of the child
- Since parent is not sandboxed, it could be then exploited (say by
  leveraging another vulnerability such as the one discussed last week for
  Firefox) for arbitrary code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4033-1/][USN-4033-1]]] libmysofa vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10672][CVE-2019-10672]]
- C library to read SOFA (Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics) files
  - Used by lots of different applications that handle audio, like
    gstreamer, ffmpeg, smplayer, blender etc
- Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow - crash -> DoS or possible
  code-execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4034-1/][USN-4034-1]]] ImageMagick vulnerabilities

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-12805][CVE-2017-12805]]
- Used by many automated systems for image processing etc
- Many memory corruption issues fixed - most able to cause at least a crash
  (DoS) but might be possible to also get RCE
- Also updated the default policy to disable support for PostScript and PDF
  formats (since these are handle by GhostScript which has a long history
  of security issues itself) - Cosmic + Disco
  - This is already the case on Bionic ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3785-1/][USN-3785-1]] - [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-7/][Episode 7]])

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4035-1/][USN-4035-1]]] Ceph vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3821][CVE-2019-3821]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16889][CVE-2018-16889]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16846][CVE-2018-16846]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14662][CVE-2018-14662]]
- 2 CVEs affect ceph in Xenial
  - dm-crypt disk encryption keys were able to be read by users with
    read-only permissions - fixed to ensure need an explicit permission to
    read keys
  - DoS from authenticated RGW users
- 2 Cosmic+Disco
  - Does not properly sanitize encryption keys when outputting debug log
    information for v4 auth -so encryption keys would be output in
    plaintext to debug logs
    - fixed to sanitize before output
    - won't be fixed for Xenial since upstream hasn't backported this and
      there are many instances of other sensitive info being logged there
      as well
  - DoS by unauthenticated remote users via the civetweb frontend - as they
    could create connections to a RADOS gateway to exhaust file descriptors
    for the gateway service causing it to run out and fail to create new
    connections
    - Close fd on error path

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4036-1/][USN-4036-1]]] OpenStack Neutron vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9735][CVE-2019-9735]]
- Networking abstraction layer of OpenStack
- Allows to define security groups with rules which then get executed by a
  driver using a particular underlying technology
- Rules can specify protocols and source / destination ports
- iptables driver would execute rules but if encountered an error (such as
  a protocol was specified along with a port but the protocol doesn't
  support ports - like VRRP) then it would error out and not apply further
  rules from the security group
  - So could block other rules from being applied
- Fixed to ensure port arguments are only applied to protocols which
  support them

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4037-1/][USN-4037-1]]] policykit-desktop-privileges update
- Affecting Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
- PolicyKit policy update for USB Creator
  - Previously would allow a user with admin privileges (ie. in the
    admin/sudo group) to overwrite disks (ie create bootable USB images)
    without prompting for authentication
  - Now updated to require the user to also authenticate as well

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4038-1/][USN-4038-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4038-2/][USN-4038-2]]] bzip2 vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12900][CVE-2019-12900]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3189][CVE-2016-3189]]
- UAF via crafted bzip2 file - crash, DoS
- OOB write from crafted bzip2 which contains too many selectors - possible
  RCE
  - Turns out this breaks decompression of some bzip2 files created by the
    lbzip2 utility since it would use an invalid number of selectors -
    [[https://gitlab.com/federicomenaquintero/bzip2/issues/24][upstream still pondering how to fix this]]

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4040-1/][USN-4040-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4040-2/][USN-4040-2]]] Expat vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20843][CVE-2018-20843]]
- CPU DoS if XML names contained large number of colons (used to specify
  namespace prefix)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4042-1/][USN-4042-1]]] poppler vulnerabilities
- 13 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9903][CVE-2019-9903]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18897][CVE-2018-18897]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-9865][CVE-2017-9865]]
- Usual mix of issues
  - Memory leak
  - Stack exhaustion -> crash, DoS
  - 3*Heap-based buffer over-reads
  - NULL pointer dereference
  - Various floating point exception issues
  - Assertion failure
  - Heap-based buffer under-write - so write at a negative index of a heap
    allocated buffer - crash, DoS or possible RCE via heap metadata or
    object corruption

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4041-1/][USN-4041-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4041-2/][USN-4041-2]]] Linux kernel update
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty ESM (HWE), Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11479][CVE-2019-11479]]
- Final SACK Panic issue ([[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-37/][Episode 37]]) - added sysctl to easily set MSS (is
  usually hard-coded to 48) - so can be increased to avoid this DoS issue

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-2518][CVE-2017-2518]]
- Mix of various issues, most involving various memory corruption problems
  - UAFs, DoS (crash), heap-based buffer over-reads (crash -> DoS or
    possible information disclosure), incorrect use of temporary
    directories, race-condition leading to NULL pointer dereference,
    integer overflow -> buffer overflow -> crash / code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4021-1/][USN-4021-1]]] libvirt vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3886][CVE-2019-3886]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10132][CVE-2019-10132]]
- DoS where some APIs in the guest agents could be accessed by read-only
  users - this would cause libvirt to block and cause a DoS
- Privilege escalation due to insecure permissions on the virt-lockd and
  virt-logd UNIX domain sockets - these are created by systemd unit files
  but were created as world writable - and the daemons don't try and
  authenticate the user - so anyone could use these sockets to potentially
  elevate privileges - so fixed by ensuring the systemd socket definitions
  specify the right mode.

- Different DoS where one client could cause others to be disconnected by
  sending invalid an UTF-8 topic string - which would cause other clients
  which do reject invalid UTF-8 to disconnect themselves

- Various issues including:
  - Possible RCE (was serializing encryption key info into a session
    cookie) which could then be read by an attacker since it also made
    session cookie accessible via an API endpoint
  - Sample web application used a hard-coded encryption key which could
    also allow attackers to do RCE as they could easily interpose on the
    session
  - Environment variables were exposed by an example API endpoint which
    exposed host info and so remote attackers could then possibly gain
    admin access
  - Lacked brute-force password protection as wouldn't reject already
    denied hosts from repeatedly trying

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4014-1/][USN-4014-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4014-2/][USN-4014-2]]] GLib vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12450][CVE-2019-12450]]
- GLib contains GIO which is library to abstract file-IO operations
- During file copying, would create the new file with default permissions
  and then once copy was done would then set the correct permissions (based
  on the original files permissions)
- Could allow other users to read the file during the copy process
- Instead fix to create new file with restrictive permissions (only
  accessible by the current user) to avoid this

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4015-1/][USN-4015-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4015-2/][USN-4015-2]]] DBus vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12749][CVE-2019-12749]]
- DBus includes multiple authentication mechanisms - usually would just use
  credentials passed via UNIX sockets (is secure as is enforced by the
  kernel), but this is not supported on all platforms (Windows etc)
- So includes another authentication mechanism - DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1
  - In this case, the authenticating user has to prove they are who they
    say by being able to read and provide a magic value from a keyring file
    which dbus drops in the user's home directory
  - By abusing symlinks, it would be possible to point the local users
    keyring at some other file and cause DBus to read / write to some other
    file which was not intended
  - This could further be abused to point your local dbus keyring to root's
    and cause DBus to eventually confuse the local user's authentication to
    the bus as that of the root user and so allow an unprivileged user to
    authenticate as root and so then perform operations as root via DBus
- Fixed by simply only allowing DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 to authenticate as the
  same user as the DBus server owner - ie. if running DBus as root you can
  only authenticate as root, not as your local user (since this use-case is
  not actually used in practice)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4016-1/][USN-4016-1]]] Vim vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-12735][CVE-2019-12735]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-5953][CVE-2017-5953]]
- Most over-hyped bug of the week
  - https://threatpost.com/linux-command-line-editors-high-severity-bug/145569/
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/bwrjrx/vimneovim_arbitrary_code_execution_via_modelines/
- Will discuss with Joe later in the episode, but briefly:
  - Vim includes support for 'modelines'
    - This allows files to include custom settings such as indentation, file
      type etc so that editing is consistent
    - Only a subset of vim commands can be permitted - ie. set - and then not
      everything can be set by modelines - and is meant to be side-effect
      free
    - However, the source! command is still allowed - this reads extra
      commands from a file as though typed by the user and is done so outside
      the sandbox
    - So is possible to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary commands via
      the modeline (since vim supports running external commands from the
      editor itself)
    - PoC included running a reverse shell by just opening a crafted file
  - However, modelines are disabled by default in Debian (and hence Ubuntu)
    so unless a user had specifically enabled it in their own vimrc they are
    safe
  - Patched to disable sourcing a file from the modeline or from within the
    sandbox at all
- One extra low priority issue when vim could be made to crash via a
  crafted spell file (this is used to store locally spelling additions etc)

- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-33/][Episode 33]] - Firefox update to version 67.0 - contained a regression so
  updated to 67.0.1 ([[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-35/][Episode 35]]) - this also contained another regression
  where Firefox would fail to load correctly if run in safe-mode. So
  upstream released 67.0.2 which is this new update.

  during network namespace cleanup that could lead to a UAF.
  - RDS is blacklisted by default in Ubuntu AND this is only able to be
    exploited by a local attacker
- NULL pointer dereference in LSI Logic MegaRAID driver

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4006-1/][USN-4006-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4006-2/][USN-4006-2]]] Linux kernel vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Cosmic & Bionic HWE
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11191][CVE-2019-11191]]
- Old a.out binary format for 32-bit platforms - so only affects i386
  kernel users, and only affects setuid a.out binaries (none in archive)
- Kernel would not setup permissions early enough and so could allow ASLR
  to be bypassed, weakening system protections to then more easily exploit
  some other existing vulnerablity in the given setuid a.out binary
- Have also disabled a.out support in general going forward as this is a
  relic of the past

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4007-1/][USN-4007-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4007-2/][USN-4007-2]]] Linux kernel vulnerability

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11190][CVE-2019-11190]]
- a.out issue, plus RDS and MegaRAID NULL ptr dereference
- Similar to a.out issue, in general ASLR could be bypassed on setuid
  binaries due to a similar race-condition
- This fix also requires some AppArmor profile changes

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4008-2/][USN-4008-2]]] AppArmor update

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11190][CVE-2019-11190]]
- Updated AppArmor profiles to handle new kernel behavoiur as a result of
  the fix for CVE-2019-11190 (ASLR bypass on setuid executables).
- When executing a binary, will then appear to require mmap privileges of
  the resulting binary, so ensure all current profiles are updated to add
  this permission on the appropriate rules

- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10149][CVE-2019-10149]]
- Possible remote exploit of popular MTA
- Embargo broke early - was expected to be public 11th June - as a
  consequence, we released our update once the details were publicly known
  - It was possible to include shell directives in the recipients email
    address which would be evaluated by the exim process (and hence as
    root) - but would require the attacker to keep a connection open to the
    server for 7 days by transmitting 1 byte every few minutes.

- Was originally fixed in 2016 for the str.format method - but at the time
  missed the similar str.format_map method - so both fixed in this update

- Thunderbird 60.7.0 - latest upstream release includes a heap of security fixes
- Most all come from Firefox (DoS, bypass same-origin restrictions or RCE)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3996-1/][USN-3996-1]]] GNU Screen vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6806][CVE-2015-6806]]
- Old low priority issue fixed for ESM releases (fixed back in 2015
  upstream so screen in Xenial, Bionic etc not affected)
- Attacker could cause a crash due to stack overrun via recursion due to
  large number of repeated ANSI escape sequences in output

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3968-2/][USN-3968-2]]] Sudo vulnerability

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3998-1/][USN-3998-1]]] Evolution Data Server vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15587][CVE-2018-15587]]
- Research from Marcus Brinkmann showed it was possible to create an
  encrypted email with a zero-length encrypted section along with
  unencrypted contents which Evolution (and other email clients) would show
  as being encrypted.
- Mail clients call out to gpg (gnupg) to decrypt the email but are lax in
  parsing GPGs output and so confuse the whole email as being encrypted
- Due to SW arch of evolution, part of this fix is done in Evolution itself
  (to better highlight to the user that the email contains unencrypted
  portions) and part is done in the backend (Evolution Data Server) to
  properly parse output of gnupg

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10844][CVE-2018-10844]]
- 3 CVEs related to "Lucky Thirteen" attack (originally published in 2013)
  - Timing attack against TLS implementations that use CBC
  - One countermeasure was to use "psuedo constant time"
  - New research showed this is not sufficient (incidentally one of the
    researchers was Adi Shamir, co-inventor of the RSA algorithm - the "S"
    in RSA)
- 1 CVE from Tavis Ormandy (double-free when handling X.509 certificates) -
  crash -> DoS, code execution
- Last CVE - uninitialized pointer could be dereferenced when handling
  certain post-handshake messages - likely crash -> DoS

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4000-1/][USN-4000-1]]] Corosync vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1084][CVE-2018-1084]]
- Integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow (read), able to be
  triggered by an unauthenticated user - crash -> DoS

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4001-1/][USN-4001-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/4001-2/][USN-4001-2]]] libseccomp vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9893][CVE-2019-9893]]
- Seccomp allows to write policies to act on system calls arguments via
  BPF - includes comparison operators like less than (LT) etc - Jann Horn
  discovered that on 64-bit platforms it did not generate correct BPF to
  perform comparisons correctly
- In this case, the updates from upstream relied on other upstream changes
  so we chose to upgrade seccomp entirely rather than try and backport the
  fixes as they were too involved and so less risk overall in upgrading the
  version than in backporting

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20060][CVE-2018-20060]]
- When validating certs for HTTPS, could specify a set of certs to validate
  against - however it would always include the system CA certs as well -
  so could validate successfully even if cert is not in chain of explicitly
  desired set - fixed to NOT include system certs in this case
- Possible CRLF injection
- Would possibly expose HTTP authorization credentials across different
  origin hosts as after authenticating, if being redirected to a different
  origin host, would still include the Authorization header from the old
  host to the new host - fixed by ensuring this defaults to being off

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Clarifications to documentation regarding latest Intel MDS vulnerabilities
- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown/TechFAQ
- Updated to describe situation when doing virtualisation:
  - To enable guest to mitigate various speculative execution
    vulnerabilities, need to ensure the guest CPU emulates the various CPU
    features (such as pcid, ssbd etc).
  - Depends on workloads - if running untrusted code in guests or not etc.
  - Previously QEMU would define various CPU models such as Broadwell-IBRS
    which would include support for this emulation. However, most of the
    newer features ssbd, md_clear etc are not included in these CPU models.
  - So instead need to explicitly enable them - this can be done in a few ways:
    - Can just passthrough host CPU features directly - recommended
      approach if NOT going to migrating guests across hosts (since if has
      different features will cease to work)
    - Otherwise manually enable features directly as a subset of the
      supported features from all the various hosts in your datacenter -
      depending on whether using QEMU on the command-line or libvirt to
      configure has different ways to specify this but same idea for both
**** Security Team plans for 19.10 development cycle
- 19.10 cycle roadmap meeting was held in Lyon a 2 weeks ago - each Ubuntu
  team presented on the progress etc from the 19.04 cycle as well as their
  plans for the 19.10 cycle
- Security team highlights for 19.10:
  - Automate more parts of our processes around triage of code reviews,
    reactive package updates etc
  - Review and incorporate KSPP recommendations for kernel hardening
  - GCC -fstack-clash-protection and -fcf-protection as default
  - Various snapd enhancements (daemon user, OpenGL support, audio
    migration)
  - AppArmor features - prompting, more groundwork for fine-grained network
    mediation

** Overview
This week we look at updates to cover the latest Intel CPU vulnerabilities
(MDS - aka RIDL, Fallout, ZombieLoad), plus other vulnerabilies in
PostgreSQL, ISC DHCP, Samba and more, whilst special guest this week is
Seth Arnold from the Ubuntu Security Team to talk Main Inclusion Review
code audits.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
37 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3972-1/][USN-3972-1]]] PostgreSQL vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10130][CVE-2019-10130]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10129][CVE-2019-10129]]
- Stores statistics for columns by sampling values from that column
  - Security policy allows to restrict users from viewing particular rows
  - But sampling would not take into account security policy
  - User could craft a leaky operator which would return the sampled data
    and effectively bypass the security policy
  - Fixed to only allow non-leakproof operators to use sampled data when no
    relevant row security policies in place
- Arbitrary server memory able to be read by executing a crafted INSERT
  statement on a partitioned table (only affects PostgreSQL 11 so only
  Disco)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3973-1/][USN-3973-1]]] DHCP vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6470][CVE-2019-6470]]
- DHCP server could crash due to mismatch in BIND internal memory
  management and DHCP server code
- BIND in Bionic + Cosmic contained a change which zeroed out an internal
  index to indicate it was unused - however 0 is still a valid index in the
  DHCP server codebase - and so this could cause a use-after free (since
  would be free'd, index set to 0 by BIND lib but then still used later
  since 0 is valid). Instead changed to track indexes correctly to account
  for this behaviour.

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3974-1/][USN-3974-1]]] VCFtools vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-11130][CVE-2018-11130]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-11129][CVE-2018-11129]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-11099][CVE-2018-11099]]
- Tools for working with VCF files (1000 Genomes Project)
- Fuzzed in conjunction with AddressSanitizer in clang using crafted VCF files
  - Read-based heap buffer overflow - crash, DoS
  - 2 * use after free -> crash, DoS / code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3975-1/][USN-3975-1]]] OpenJDK vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2698][CVE-2019-2698]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2697][CVE-2019-2697]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2684][CVE-2019-2684]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2602][CVE-2019-2602]]
- 2 affecting both openjdk-11 and openjdk-8
  - CPU DoS via BigDecimal implementation operating on particular values
  - Sandbox escape due to incorrect skeleton class selection in the RMI registry
- 2 sandbox escapes affecting only openjdk-8 via the 2D graphics component

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3976-1/][USN-3976-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3976-2/][USN-3976-2]]] Samba vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16860][CVE-2018-16860]]
- Kerberos (as used in AD) contains an extension to allow a service to
  request a Kerberos ticket to itself on behalf of a non-Kerberos
  authenticated user (allows to use Kerberos for all internal code-paths)
- Can be proxied over the network so that a privileged server can proxy on
  behalf of the non-Kerberos authenticated user
- This proxied request contains a checksum (which can be keyed to prevent
  spoofing) - BUT this is not enforced - so an attacker can intercept the
  proxied request and rewrite the user name to any other one in the KDC AND
  replace the checksum with a simple CRC32 - as this can be computed
  without any prior knowledge

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3986-1/][USN-3986-1]]] Wireshark vulnerabilities
- 9 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9214][CVE-2019-9214]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10894][CVE-2019-10894]]
- Updated to latest 2.6.8 release to fix many issues in various packet
  dissectors that would cause wireshark to crash

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3988-1/][USN-3988-1]]] MediaInfo vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11373][CVE-2019-11373]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11372][CVE-2019-11372]]
- CLI tool for reading metadata from various audio/video files
- 2* OOB read -> crash, DoS

*** [LSN-0051-1] Linux kernel vulnerability
- 4 CVEs for Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) vulnerabilities
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11091][CVE-2019-11091]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12130][CVE-2018-12130]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12127][CVE-2018-12127]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12126][CVE-2018-12126]]
- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/MDS
- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-mds-vulnerability-what-it-why-it-works-and-how-mitigate-it
- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/deeper-look-mds-vulnerability
- Too invasive to be addressed by Livepatch - requires updates to the
  kernel and new microcode to fix
- Intel CPUs contain various microarchitectural elements - store buffers,
  load ports, fill buffers - which get used to complete architectural
  operations (read from an address etc)
  - 4 CVEs due to the different use of these different buffers in the
    various techniques
  - RIDL (Rogue in-flight data load) - fill buffers and load ports
  - Fallout - store buffers
  - ZombieLoad - independent discovery of fill-buffer variant of RIDL
- These get reused across operations, and in particular get reused across
  hyperthreads executing on the same CPU core
- A malicious process can use speculative execution sampling techniques to
  infer the contents of one of these microarchitectural buffers - so could
  see data from a process that had previously been executing on the same
  CPU core OR in the case of HT can see data from a process executing
  concurrently on the same core
- In the case of a single core can be fixed by first adding new behaviour
  to the unused VERW instruction to clear these buffers as a microcode
  update
- Then updating the Linux kernel to call this new VERW instruction when
  switching tasks, VMs etc
- However, does not mitigate in the case of SMT
- So only way to properly mitigate is to disable SMT as well
- In the case of virtualisation, the guest does the task switching so it
  needs to clear these buffers - update to QEMU + libvirt to expose this
  new CPU capability to the guest so that it can perform the flushing
  itself
- Kernel + QEMU updates also contain fixes for other CVEs
- Kernels updated for all supported releases including the HWE kernels

- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3820][CVE-2019-3820]]
- Local user could potentially bypass various restrictions of the lock
  screen - menu items can be activated by keyboard combinations - these
  could then be used to take screenshots (and fill up disk space), close
  windows behind the lock screen or start the screen reader which could
  read out the contents of windows behind the lock screen.
- Fixed by disabling all menu items when the screen is locked

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7076][CVE-2016-7076]]
- Fails to properly parse /proc/PID/stat - this is used to determine the
  controlling tty - this name could contain newlines - sudo would only read
  one line of input and so would get a truncated name - when sudo is used
  with SELinux this allows to confuse sudo as to where the destination for
  stdout / stderr and so cause sudo to overwrite and arbitrary file by
  creating a symlink from the supposed tty to the destination file.
- Fixed by ensuring to parse the full name including any newlines
- sudo contains the ability to restrict users with sudo access to running
  further commands via the NOEXEC tag
  - Does this by LD_PRELOAD to replace exec() and other functions with
    versions that return an error
  - wordexp() performs shell expansion on a string and so can contain shell
    directives to run a command and get the output $(foo) - this can run
    commands and so would not be stopped by LD_PRELOAD lib - so a user can
    run a binary which does wordexp() they could bypass this restriction
  - Fixed by adding wordexp() to the LD_PRELOAD wrapper AND by adding a
    seccomp filter to stop all execve() entirely

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3969-1/][USN-3969-1]], USN-3969-2] wpa_supplicant and hostapd vulnerability

19 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3957-1/][USN-3957-1]]] MySQL vulnerabilities
- 8 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2683][CVE-2019-2683]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2632][CVE-2019-2632]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2628][CVE-2019-2628]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2627][CVE-2019-2627]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2614][CVE-2019-2614]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2592][CVE-2019-2592]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2581][CVE-2019-2581]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2566][CVE-2019-2566]]
- Latest upstream version 5.7.26 includes fixes for 8 different issues including:
  - Unauthenticated remote attacker could gain complete access to all MySQL server data
  - Multiple versions of privileged attacker could hang / crash MySQL server

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3958-1/][USN-3958-1]]] GStreamer Base Plugins vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9928][CVE-2019-9928]]
- Heap based buffer overflow in RTSP connection parser - could allow a
  malicious server to gain remote code execution on the client - session id
  can contain attributes separated by semi-colons - would assume when
  encountering a semi-colon that this delimits the maximum size of the
  session id - however the session id has a maximum size of 512 bytes -
  would overflow by using the user-supplied session id length rather than
  sticking to the maximum structure length - changed to only parse up to
  the maximum size of the structure to ensure we then don't overflow when
  copying

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3959-1/][USN-3959-1]]] Evince vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11459][CVE-2019-11459]]
- Failed to check return values when calling functions for libTIFF - these
  return the pixel data from an embedded TIFF image - on failure would end
  up rendering uninitialised memory rather than the TIFF image - fixed to
  check return values and bail out on error

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3960-1/][USN-3960-1]]] WavPack vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11498][CVE-2019-11498]]
- Fuzzing via valgrind - found if no sample rate was specified then a stack
  declared but uninitialized value would be used - could cause a crash etc
  since could be anything - fixed to initialise it to 0 and to check if
  still zero before proceeding to process

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3961-1/][USN-3961-1]]] Dovecot vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11499][CVE-2019-11499]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11494][CVE-2019-11494]]
- Two issues related to authentication in recent versions of dovecot - if
  client aborts authentication the serer could crash due to a NULL pointer
  dereference, and if using TLS but send an invalid authentication message
  could crash as well

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3962-1/][USN-3962-1]]] libpng vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7317][CVE-2019-7317]]
- Use after free in png image cleanup - originally was called under
  png_safe_execute() - this is an internal function which itself calls
  png_image_free() - so after freeing the image would free it a second time
  in certain conditions - changed to just call the free function directly
  rather than via png_safe_execute()

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3963-1/][USN-3963-1]]] Memcached vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11596][CVE-2019-11596]]
- Possible NULL pointer dereference via local command interface due to
  insufficient checks when parsing input - commands require 4 input tokens
  but only checked for 3 (off-by-one) - could allow an attacker with access
  to the command interface to crash memcached

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3953-2/][USN-3953-2]]] PHP vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11035][CVE-2019-11035]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11034][CVE-2019-11034]]
- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-29/][Episode 29]] covered these for standard supported releases - this update is
  for the ESM releases - two bugs in EXIF tag handling

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3964-1/][USN-3964-1]]] python-gnupg vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6690][CVE-2019-6690]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12020][CVE-2018-12020]]
- Possible to trick gnupg to decrypt ciphertext other than the intended one
  when an attacker can control the passphrase to gnupg and the ciphertext
  is assumed trusted - this uses the command-interface of gnupg and passes
  the passphrase directly to it - along with the ciphertext - so if
  attacker includes newlines in the supplied passphrase can then inject
  their own ciphertext (or plaintext in the context of encryption) - fixed
  to check passphrase does not contain line-feed or carriage return
  characters
- Possible to trick by including what looks like the return response from
  gnupg directly in the filename to be decrypted when using verbose output
  mode - fixed by sanitising this filename first

53 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3947-1/][USN-3947-1]], USN-3947-2] Libxslt vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11068][CVE-2019-11068]]
- Library to transform XML via XML definitions
- Includes a security framework since XSLT can define operations to
  fetch/read/write files and resources etc
- Various functions would return 0 if an operation is not allowed by the
  framework which was checked for and correctly disallowed - BUT they could
  also return -1 on error (say from a potentially bad URL) which would not
  be caught and so then would proceed and would fetch from the URL in
  question thereby violating the security policy
- Fixed to also check for error codes on handle the same as an explicit
  policy violation

27 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3939-1/][USN-3939-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3939-2/][USN-3939-2]]] Samba vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3880][CVE-2019-3880]]
- Symlink path traversal vulnerability in the Windows Registry service emulation RPC API end-point
- Allows a local user to create a new registry file anywhere they have Unix
  permissions to do so within the Samba share
  - Bypasses share restrictions such as read-only and share ACLs
  - Also allows to create the file outside the share itself if there is
    already a symlink pointing outside the shared areas
- Fixed by removing the ability to save or restore registry keys at all via
  this RPC API end-point

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3940-1/][USN-3940-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3940-2/][USN-3940-2]]] ClamAV vulnerabilities

- 3 file-handling issues
  - 2 OOB heap read when handling PE (Windows EXE and DLL) and PDF files ->
    crash -> DoS
  - OOB heap write when scanning OLE2 files (old format Microsoft Office
    documents), crash -> DoS or possible code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3941-1/][USN-3941-1]]] Lua vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6706][CVE-2019-6706]]
- UAF if calling debug.upvaluejoin() with the same function for both function parameters

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3938-1/][USN-3938-1]]] systemd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3842][CVE-2019-3842]]
- Failure to properly sanitize environment before using XDG_SEAT
- Attacker could set XDG_SEAT such that they can have actions checked
  against the wrong PolicyKit policy
- Allows a remotely logged in attacker (SSH) to run commands which should
  be restricted to only physically present users
- Fixed by using secure_getenv() rather than just getenv() - so that if
  running via su the existing value is effectively scrubbed from the
  environment and ignored

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3942-1/][USN-3942-1]]] OpenJDK 7 vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-2422][CVE-2019-2422]]
- Information leak allows a remote attacker to possibly leverage this to
  bypass the Java sandbox

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3943-1/][USN-3943-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3943-2/][USN-3943-2]]] Wget vulnerabilities

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20483][CVE-2018-20483]]
- Heap buffer overflow due to improper memory management - crash -> DoS or possible code execution
- By default wget would store the origin URL in an extended attribute on the downloaded file
  - Could include username / password
  - getfattr -d to dump
  - changed to NOT store extended attributes by default AND to strip out
    any credentials when doing so
  - doesn't effect Precise ESM

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3937-2/][USN-3937-2]]] Apache vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1312][CVE-2018-1312]]

- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-27/][Episode 27]] covered mod_auth_digest bypass for other supported releases
- Also includes 3 other issues:
  - Nonce generated to prevent reply attacks for HTTP digest authentication
    challenenge wasn't sufficiently random
    - Could allow and attacker to reply across a cluster of servers with
      the same common digest authentication configuration
    - changed to actually use a proper random source
  - Possible OOB read -> crash -> DoS
  - Possible one-byte memory corruption if specify a character encoding of
    only 1 byte (since assumes is at least 2 bytes and so writes a NULL at
    index +2 which could be past the end of the header) - crash, DoS

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3944-1/][USN-3944-1]]] wpa_supplicant and hostapd vulnerabilities
- 5 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-10743][CVE-2016-10743]]

- Fix fallback to low-quality PRNG if failed to get an actual random value for a WPS pin
- Multiple vulnerabilities discovered in the implementation of WPA3 in
  hostapd and wpa_supplicant (aka Dragonblood)
  - 2 apply to SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals , also known as
    Dragonfly Key Exchange) not relevant since we don't enable SAE support
    in our builds (this is used for initial key exchange instead of PSK)
  - 4 apply to the use of EAP-PWD - Extensible Authentication Protocol
    Password
    - cache side channel attack
    - reflection attack
      - may allow an attacker to authenticate without the password but
        likely not derive session key or complete the key exchange so no
        loss of confidentiality
    - 2 failure to validate crypto components
      - could allow attacker to authenticate AND gain access to session key
        and get network access

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3945-1/][USN-3945-1]]] Ruby vulnerabilities
- 6 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic

- Symlink directory traversal issue - gem would delete the target
  destination before creating any new directories or files when extracting
  a Gem - as this is often run via sudo could allow to delete anything on
  target system
  - Fixed to check target paths are symlinks
- 5 different code-injection attacks:
  - 4 via injection of terminal escape sequences in debug code paths to stdout
  - one via eval() of the stub line in a gemspec file

** Overview
Carpe Diem for Apache HTTP Server, plus updates for Dovecot, PolicyKit and the Linux kernel, and we talk to Joe McManus about the recent Asus ShadowHammer supply chain attack and more.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
52 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3928-1/][USN-3928-1]]] Dovecot vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7524][CVE-2019-7524]]
- Local user root privilege escalation
  - Stack buffer overflow - indexer-worker processes missing bounds check when copying from the index
  - If local user can modify the dovecot index then could leverage this
    for code-execution in the indexer process context
  - Mitigated by usual hardening techniques (ASLR, stack-protector,
    read-only GOT (via RELRO & BIND_NOW))

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3929-1/][USN-3929-1]]] Firebird vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-6369][CVE-2017-6369]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9323][CVE-2014-9323]]
- Remote authenticated users execute code
- Remote un-authenticated user DoS via op_response action with a non-empty status

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3934-1/][USN-3934-1]]] PolicyKit vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6133][CVE-2019-6133]]
- [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-23/][Episode 23]] - fixed kernel to make process start_time via fork() more atomic
- Updated policykit to also check UIDs match (so now checks start_time,
  PID and UID so can't use another user's authorisations)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3935-1/][USN-3935-1]]] BusyBox vulnerabilities
- 10 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-5747][CVE-2019-5747]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-5325][CVE-2011-5325]]
- Mix of issues across various components in BusyBox
  - udhcpc:
    - Information disclosure of stack memory in dhcp client / server
      (shared component) due to failure to check DHCP options are correct
      size - original fix was incomplete so this got 2 CVEs
    - Heap buffer overflow via DHCP option parsing of OPTION_6RD (IPv6
      rapid deployment on IPv4 infra)
    - Integer overflow -> heap-based OOB write -> crash -> DoS / code
      execution
  - wget:
    - Heap buffer overflow in wget
  - shell:
    - Failure to sanitize filenames during tab completion - could allow
      code execution etc as user who is running the shell
  - archive handling
    - Integer overflow in bzip2 decompression - OOB write - crash -> DoS
      / code execution?
    - Pointer misuse in zip decompression - OOB read - crash -> DoS
    - directory traversal due to symlinks which point outside the
      current working directory when decompressing tar archives
      (tyhicks)
  - module loading
    - allows users to load modules which are otherwise restricted -
      assumes modules could specify the path so uses basename() on the
      module name - so just need to include a / in the module name to
      circumvent other checks


*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3937-1/][USN-3937-1]]] Apache HTTP Server vulnerabilities
- 6 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-0220][CVE-2019-0220]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-0217][CVE-2019-0217]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17189][CVE-2018-17189]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-0211][CVE-2019-0211]]
- "Carpe Diem" and others
  - Local root privilege escalation due to an OOB array access resulting
    in arbitrary function call when apache gracefully restarts - done
    daily via logrotate at 6:25am
    - affects mod_prefork, mod_worker and mod_event
    - main server (running as root) shares a memory segment (the
      scoreboard) with low-privileged worker processes
    - PID, last request handled etc - maintained by the worker
    - worker stores an index into global buckets array in the privileged parent
    - this gets used on restart to restart the worker but no check is done to ensure this is valid
    - so since is in shm child can change this index to ensure it points back into the shm segment where it has write access
    - the bucket contains a function pointer to restart worker - so
      since this is now indexed from the shm segment can make this point
      to any function of choice - AND this gets executed as root by the
      parent
    - Requires some other bug to turn this into a remote exploit since
      need to get R/W access remotely on a worker process
  - Failure to normalize URLs in a consistent manner - LocationMatch and
    RewriteRule might not get applied correctly
  - Race condition in mod_auth_digest could allow user with valid
    credentials to impersonate another and bypass access controls
  - read after free on string comparison in mod_http2 - crash, DoS
  - failure to respect session expiry time in mod_session_cookie
  - DoS via slow-loris type attack to occupy server threads

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3936-1/][USN-3936-1]]] AdvanceCOMP vulnerability

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19824][CVE-2018-19824]]
- Jann Horn (GPZ):
  - mmap minimum address bypass - could allow to turn a kernel NULL
    pointer dereference into code execution
  - ASN.1 decoding for SNMP NAT missing length checks - OOB R/W possible
  - side-channel attack due to speculation on pointer arithmetic in eBPF
    programs (Spectre V1)
    - mitigated when secure boot due to lockdown patches blocking BPF
      program loading
  - Reference counting race-condition in KVM -> UAF -> guest VM crash
- UAF + OOPS in IPMI due to race-condition on restart
- Memory leak on error path of vfs read operations -> DoS
- UAF in SCTP sendmsg - crash / code execution
- UAF in AF_ALG due to failure to NULL structure members
  - Originally misclassified by NVD as remotely exploitable, confusion
    over socket() use by crypto API?
- Info leak and a UAF in KVM when using nested virtualisation - not
  enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels unless if install QEMU - this is
  enabled automatically
- 2 different information leak of heap memory in bluetooth subsystem
  triggerable by unauthenticated remote attacker
- UAF in ALSA USB sound device handling mentioned in [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-20/][Episode 20]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9810][CVE-2019-9810]]
- Firefox 66.0.1 (mentioned briefly last week) - fixes two vulnerabilities discovered during Pwn2Own
- Both in the IonMonkey JIT compiler
  - Incorrect alias information for the Array.prototype.slice method
    leads to missing bounds check and a buffer overflow - code execution
    as a result
  - Type confusion in handling of ,__proto__ mutations - ,__proto__ is
    used to modify the Prototype of an object to be mutated - used for
    object inheritance in JavaScript - allows arbitrary memory
    read/write and therefore code execution as a result

- Firefox 66 & 66.0.1 contained a regression - so upstream released 66.0.2
- Broke keyboard handling in Office 365, iCloud and IBM WebMail -
  Firefox 66 changed the way keycode handling works so these websites
  and others which use older, deprecated methods to get the keycode have
  been added to an internal fallback list to use the old method

  data - crash, DoS
- Failure to check available data length when processing image
  thumbnails - OOB read -> crash -> DoS
- OOB read of 1 byte when handling EXIF image data - crash -> DoS
- During file rename, if file is moved across file-systems, the new file
  briefly is world readable allowing anyone to read it - fixed by
  ensuring umask is used correctly so that the new file always has
  restrictive permissions from the outset

- Heap-based buffer overflow in TCP emulation
- OOB read in i2c handling allowing a local attacker within a guest who
  has permission to execute i2c commands could read qemu host process
  stack memory
- Plan9 FS host-directory sharing race-condition on file rename -> crash
  -> DoS
- 2 issues in USB MTP handling:
  - time-of-check to time-of-use error allows attacker with write access
    to the shared host filesystem can use this to navigate host FS in
    context of QEMU host process and read any therefore read any file
    which QEMU can on the host
  - Path traversal flaw due to improper filename sanitisation - allow to
    read-write arbitrary host files -> Dos or code execution on the host
- Updates for Paravirtualised RDMA subsystem:
  - DoS due to infinite loop
  - NULL pointer dereference due to missing read method
  - Fix various memory leaks
  - Various other NULL pointer dereferences plus a failure to check
    parameters leading to possible extreme memory allocation
  - Fix OOB read triggerable by guest

- Apache module to provide authentication and authorisation via SAML 2.0 IdP
- Possible to bypass authorisation checks when also using mod_proxy
- Fix an open-redirect via the logout endpoint - could encode an
  absolute URL using backward-slashes (\) in place of forward-slashes
  (/) and this would be propagated by the endpoint to the client where
  the browser would convert these and follow the redirect - due to
  mismatch in how browsers will convert these but apache's own internal
  URI parsing does not

*** Ubuntu Hardening Tips
- Paul Waring got in touch to mention his tips for hardening new Ubuntu installations:
  - Install and configure unattended-upgrades
  - Install UFW and block all incoming connections except specific services
    - Can be done easily via ansible from just a few lines of YAML
  - For servers:
    - Install SSHGuard to ban IP addresses with too many failed login attempts
    - Require TLS for all services via LetsEncrypt + certbot
    - Configure SSH to permit only key-based authentication
    - For wordpress installations - install wp-cli to auto-update themes
      and plugins
  - Automate as much of this as possible for automatic hardening

- Heap buffer overflow able to be triggered when mounting a filesystem
  onto a mount point with path name greater than PATH_MAX, and from a
  current working directory which has a path name also greater than
  PATH_MAX
- Contents of buffers is attacker controlled so heap can be overflown
  with attacker controlled input - likely to leverage into arbitrary
  code execution
- Contrived example BUT in Debian and Ubuntu ntfs-3g is setuid root -
  which then leads to root privilege escalation with arbitrary code
  execution
- Update was released within hours of the bug being made public to fix
  the heap buffer overflow
- Currently testing ntfs-3g as not-setuid root to release in a future
  update to avoid any other possible privilege escalation bugs in the
  future

  last week so expect another Firefox update today or tomorrow)
  - Multiple memory safety issues fixed, possible code execution as a result
  - 3 issues in FTP modal dialogs allow to either DoS user via

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3917-1/][USN-3917-1]]] snapd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7303][CVE-2019-7303]]
- Jann Horn reported the seccomp blacklist for TIOCSTI can be bypassed
- snapd creates a seccomp filter for each snap which is designed to
  block TIOCSTI (as this can be used to fake input to other processes
  outside of the sandbox)
- This is a 32-bit value to the ioctl system call, but on 64-bit
  architectures the kernel does this comparison as a 64-bit integer - so
  can be circumvented by using a 64-bit value to ioctl systemcall which
  has other bits set in the upper 32 bits - since when seccomp does
  comparison it uses the full 64 bits - so it won't match the 32-bit
  value of TIOCSTI and so will be allowed - but then when used as the
  ioctl() argument it will correctly be truncated to 32-bits and the
  ioctl will proceed
- Fixed in snapd to add a second seccomp filter to disallow anything in
  the upper 32-bits
- Initially seemed like a kernel or libseccomp issue but both currently
  document this as a limitation already so treated in the end as a
  vulnerability in snapd

10 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3885-2/][USN-3885-2]]] OpenSSH vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6111][CVE-2019-6111]]
- Originally covered in [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-20][Episode 20]] (malicious server could overwrite local client files)
- Previous fix was incomplete - missing a patch

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3901-1/][USN-3901-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3901-2/][USN-3901-2]]] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Trusty & Xenial (Bionic HWE kernel)
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6133][CVE-2019-6133]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19854][CVE-2018-19854]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18397][CVE-2018-18397]]
- 2 out of 3 from Jann Horn
  - PolicyKit provides ability to authorise an application to perform privileged actions
  - Pops up dialog for use to authorise via password - PolicyKit then caches that authorisation (5mins)
  - To identify same process in future, would look at both the PID and process start time to guard against PID reuse etc
  - However, fork() system call is not atomic, so attacked could call sys_clone() at same time as real process so it has the same start time. Can then cause kernel to block on returning back to the attacker process, effectively racing against the real process waiting for it to end, in the meantime blocking PID allocation until it has cycled around and end up with the same (reused) PID as the original authorised process (and with same start time) - so can effectively fool PolicyKit into impersonating the real process
  - Fix kernel to make fork() atomic rather than try fix PolicyKit since can't effectively do this at the process level
  - Kernel fixed to record process start time later in procedure so is much closer to when the process is visible to userspace and after userspace has a chance to delay it to mitigate this

  - Jann also discovered that userfaultfd does not properly handle access control for certain ioctl() - which allowed local users to write data into holes in a tmpfs file, even if the user only had read-only access to the file
- crypto subsystem would leak uninitialized stack memory to userspace
  - Occurred from a recent change to convert strncpy() to strlcpy() used to copy strings into various crypto buffers
  - strncpy() does not guarantee NULL termination so strlcpy() was used which does - HOWEVER, strncpy() would NULL pad out remaining bytes if buffer was longer than string - whereas strlcpy() would only NULL the first one - and so would have uninitialised bytes remaining
  - Fixed by changing back to strncpy()

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3903-1/][USN-3903-1]], USN-3903-2] Linux kernel vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Cosmic & Bionic (Cosmic HWE kernel)
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6133][CVE-2019-6133]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18397][CVE-2018-18397]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16880][CVE-2018-16880]]
- fork() start time and userfaultfd issues described earlier for the Bionic kernel update
- Out of bounds write in vhost_net driver used by virtualized guests - allows guest to corrupt host kernel memory -> host crash -> DoS, or possible arbitrary code execution in host kernel

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3902-1/][USN-3902-1]]] PHP vulnerabilities
- 5 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9023][CVE-2019-9023]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-9020][CVE-2019-9020]]
- All allow a remote attacker to crash PHP -> DoS
- 2 in XML-RPC module - remote procedure call via XML - used for various wiki backends etc - heap OOB read / UAF
- 1 in PHAR (PHP Archive) module - incorrect handling of filenames - crash via upload of crafted PHAR archive due to a heap based buffer over-read
- 1 in DNS handling (only affects PHP in Xenial) - remote attacker who can control returned DNS response could crash PHP due to buffer over-read on memcpy()
- 1 in mbstring regular expression - multiple heap based buffer over-reads in handling of multibyte sequences in regular expressions

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3904-1/][USN-3904-1]]] NVIDIA graphics drivers vulnerability
- 1 CVE addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6260][CVE-2018-6260]]
- Recent research into GPU side-channel attacks
  - [[https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~zhiyunq/pub/ccs18_gpu_side_channel.pdf][Rendered Insecure: GPU Side Channel A!acks are Practical]]
- Local users could access GPU performance counters without special privileges
- Allows to characterise the GPU workload to fingerprint websites etc being rendered
- Now requires administrator privileges to access so unable to be done from a regular user

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Comparison of Linux Hardening across distributions
- https://capsule8.com/blog/millions-of-binaries-later-a-look-into-linux-hardening-in-the-wild/
- Analyses binaries from various Linux distributions looking for hardening features (OpenSUSE, Debian, CentOS, RHEL & Ubuntu)
- Compare kernel configuration vs KSPP recommendations
- Ubuntu 18.04 ranks highest, due to proactive hardening features baked into toolchain and newer kernel taking advantage of KSPP upstream features
  - gcc is patched so anyone building on Ubuntu gets these features
  - build.snapcraft.io too
  - however is missing stack clash mitigation
- Plan to add more hardening features for 19.10 (stack clash and control-flow integrity support via gcc) and review kernel options cf. KSPP

*** Q&A
**** Does numerous bugs and regressions in Ghostscript indicate it is reaching it's EOL?
- [[https://twitter.com/docEbrown1/status/1101452172196163585][doc-E-brown via twitter]]
- Lots of recent focus -> finds bugs
- ghostscript codebase is old and gnarly and some fixes have been quite invasive
- Any new code could introduce new bugs - particularly complicated fixes -> creates more bugs (regressions)
  - (as doc-E-brown suggests, regressions indicate old code-base)
- Tavis (and others) seem to be looking elsewhere but likely still more bugs to be found
- Would be great if GS could either be made safer or a safer alternative but no-one is stepping up
- Sadly No good viable alternative currently

** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
15 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3886-1/][USN-3886-1]]] poppler vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7310][CVE-2019-7310]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20551][CVE-2018-20551]]
- Two DoS:
  - Out-of-bounds heap buffer read due to missing check for a negative index -> crash -> DoS
  - Crash due to hitting an assertion -> DoS

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3888-1/][USN-3888-1]]] GVfs vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3827][CVE-2019-3827]]
- Possible to allow a local user with admin privileges (eg. sudo group) to read arbitrary files without prompting for authorisation IF no policykit agents running
  - Policykit agents run by default so would require user to be running a difffent DE or to have uninstalled / disabled them
  - Also low impact since user has authority anyway

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3889-1/][USN-3889-1]]] WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6215][CVE-2019-6215]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6212][CVE-2019-6212]]
- Memory corruption and type confusion errors - leading to possible remote code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3890-1/][USN-3890-1]]] Django vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6975][CVE-2019-6975]]
- Could cause Django to consume a large amount of memory when formatting a decimal number with a large number of digits or with a large exponent since it would simply print every single provided character
- Possible DoS although would need a very large number to be input
- Fix is to format numbers with more than 200 characters in scientific notation

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3887-1/][USN-3887-1]]] snapd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-7304][CVE-2019-7304]]
- [[https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/02/13/Dirty-Sock.html]['DirtySock' - discovered by Chris Moberly]]
- Failed to correctly parse and validate the remote socket address
- Code had undergone refactoring and introduced this bug
- Allows to impersonate privileged user and therefore call privileged APIs via the snapd socket

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3850-2/][USN-3850-2]]] NSS vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12404][CVE-2018-12404]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12384][CVE-2018-12384]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-0495][CVE-2018-0495]]
- Covered back in [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-17/][Episode 17]]

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3891-1/][USN-3891-1]]] systemd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6454][CVE-2019-6454]]
- [[https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/18/3][Discovered by Ubuntu Security team member Chris Coulson]]
- Stack buffer overflow of DBus path field - declared as VLA, but sender could use a value larger than the stack size and therefore jump the entire stack and the guard pages
- Segmentation violation -> crash -> DoS
  - systemd does not automatically restart so brings down entire system - reboot
- Possible code execution but unlikely
- DBus and systemd need to agree on what the maximum size of various elements are - DBus spec says path could be unlimited - but in practice is less than 32MB! (dbus-daemon limits messages to this size) - systemd now limits path to 64KB AND ensures it keeps running after receiving an invalid sized path

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3892-1/][USN-3892-1]]] GDM vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3825][CVE-2019-3825]]
- Logic error in handing of timed logins (not enabled by default)
- If screen already locked, select to log in as different user - then select a user which has timed login enabled - after timeout will unlock screen of original user
- Need administrator privileges to enabled timed login for a given user so low impact

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3866-2/][USN-3866-2]]] Ghostscript regression
- Affecting Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
- Previous update for Ghostscript ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3866-1/][USN-3866-1]] - [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-18/][Episode 18]]) caused a regression in printing 4"x6" (v9.26 - upstream bug)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3893-1/][USN-3893-1]]] Bind vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-6465][CVE-2019-6465]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5745][CVE-2018-5745]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5744][CVE-2018-5744]]
- Fail to properly apply controls to zone transfers - could allow clients to request and receive a zone transfer to a dynamically loadable zone contrary to the allow-transfer ACL
- Assertion failure if a trust anchor's keys are replaced with keys using an unsupported algorithm during a key rollover when using the managed-keys feature for DNSSEC validation
- Remotely triggerable memory leak when processing particular packets - DoS

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** snapd, systemd and handling of embargoed issues
- 2 updates involving close communication between Ubuntu Security Team and external stakeholders - embargoed
- Responsible Disclosure - allows to coordinate a fix in a timely manner and then release update once all parties are ready in a coordinated manner
- Set CRD with stakeholders (reporter, upstream, other distros etc)
- Coordinate fix with upstream and other distros
- Plan coordinated updates to be released with other distros / upstream at CRD

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3814][CVE-2019-3814]]
- Interaction of username / password authentication with trusted SSL cert - can configure for user/pass but can also configure for client to present a trusted cert
- Can configure to take username from cert instead of from explicit username AND also to configure no password if using cert
- BUT if no username in cert, will use specified username - so could log in as any user

    etc
  - and this can refer to a file on the local filesystem outside the
    document structure itself
  - libreoffice ships with it's own Python interpreter that contains
    functions which can be abused to run arbitrary commands

- Three vulnerabilities in scp able to be triggered via a malicious server (low probability)
  - Fails to validate file names from the remote server match the requested ones - server can overwrite arbitrary files on local side in the target directory
  - Fails to use proper character encoding in progress display, allows server to manipulate output of client to hide output of additional files being sent
  - Fails to check if target filename is . or empty - allows remote server to change permissions of the client local directory
- Together allow a server to easily overwrite local files on the client side without the client user being aware

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** FAQs about Ubuntu Security
**** What packages are supported?
- main only (~2.3k source packages in Bionic - cf. universe ~26k source packages)
**** What timeframe?
- lifetime of the release - so from official release date to EOL date
- LTS: 5 years, non-LTS: 9 months
- [[https://www.ubuntu.com/esm][ESM provides security fixes beyond the EOL for LTS releases]]
**** Why do we backport patches instead of just updating to the lastest versions?
- Users expect high degree of stability
  - changes need caution and good rationale
  - lots of previous regressions from innocent looking changes
  - no change is completely free of risk
- Only changes which have high impact (security fixes, severe regressions, loss of data etc)
- More details see [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Why][SRU page on Ubuntu wiki]]
- So security updates must follow suit

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** An update on mincore()
- In [[https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-17/][Episode 17]] discussed changes to mincore() mitigate page cache side-channel attack
- Linus Torvalds committed a change to change the behaviour of mincore() to mitigate the vulnerability
- [[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=30bac164aca750892b93eef350439a0562a68647][Recently reverted that change]] citing too much breakage to existing users:
  - In particular Netflix have a use-case where they dump page cache across processes to aid in migration of Cassandra workloads across machines
- Instead an alternate approach to limit cache residency reporting only to processes which have write access to the particular file in question
  - ie. so if a process has write access to a file which it has open for writing it will be able to read back from mincore() which pages are mapped in the cache and which are not - so will still work for the Netflix and others case of databases wanting to know which pages are mapped or not from disk
  - will stop the case of being able to know which pages of shared system libraries etc are mapped and hence stop the original side-channel attack
  - [[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jikos/jikos.git/log/?h=pagecache-sidechannel-v2][patches not yet submitted for mm tree or others but should be soon]]

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
** apt / apt-get RCE (CVE-2019-3462)
- Discovered by Max Justicz ([[HTTPS://justi.cz/security/2019/01/22/apt-rce.html][provides a detailed write-up on his blog]])
- apt uses worker processes which communicate back to the main process when fetching content
  - workers get told what to download and where to put it and communicate back with parent via stdin/stdout
  - protocol is like HTTP, human readable text
  - can include directives from workers regarding redirects, completion (DONE) etc
  - when handling a HTTP Redirect from the server, apt http worker would append this contents in message sent back to parent
    - expect just a URI as the redirect content but could be anything - so could contain directives in the apt worker protocol which then get interpreted by the main apt process
    - so could signal DONE to parent *as well* as follow-up directives such as reporting false hashes for debs or even falsifying the location of the deb on the filesystem
    - So could use the Releases.gpg file as the location of the package on the filesystem - and actually inject our malicious package into the start of Releases.gpg - with trusted Releases.gpg content afterwards
    - Releases.gpg will still validate (since it ignores junk at the start) AND apt will still use the package since it will ignore the signature at the end
    - So can get malicious package installed - which due to debian packaging can run scripts on install etc and hence get RCE as root :(
- Fixed by simply disallowing control characters in HTTP redirect responses
- If we assume the mirrors are trusted, could have been mitigated via HTTPS
  - Since HTTPS would stop MITM attacks
  - Some Ubuntu mirrors offer HTTPS but this is not enabled by default since not *all* mirrors offer HTTPS
  - Official mirrors do not currently offer HTTPS - this is being reevaluated but is difficult for a number of reasons
  - Users can still easily enable HTTPS themselves by choosing an appropriate mirror with a HTTPS URI
- If assume mirrors are untrusted then they could still have exploited this
  - So whilst HTTPS could help in this case is not a panacea

- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1000858][CVE-2018-1000858]]
- GnuPG includes support for Web Key Directories (WKD) to allow easy discovery of public keys via HTTPS
- Allows a key to be imported from a webserver -> first need to lookup hostname via DNS SRV
- Fails to sanitize response - so performs an attacker controlled, arbitrary HTTPS GET request
  - Attacker needs to construct a malicious SRV record for the domain in question
- Possible CSRF, content injection etc
- Thunderbird will automatically use WKD via GnuPG to lookup missing keys so allows easy exploitation

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3854-1/][USN-3854-1]]] WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-4437][CVE-2018-4437]]
- Possible RCE via invalid processing of crafted web content (as usual limited details on WebKitGTK vulnerabilities...)

- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16866][CVE-2018-16866]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16865][CVE-2018-16865]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16864][CVE-2018-16864]]
- "System Down" systemd vulnerabilities
- Chris Coulson put in a heroic effort and patched quickly - Ubuntu first affected distro to release patched systemd
- Due to use of variable length arrays on the stack, allows various fields which are attacker controlled to be overflowed
- If overflow far enough can bypass kernel stack guard pages, and hence corrupt the heap
- Possible code execution as a result (original advisory contained a PoC for i386 which gained control of the instruction pointer)
- Can be mitigated via use of the gcc flag -fstack-clash-protection - this is now under review to be used by default in forthcoming Ubuntu releases

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3856-1/][USN-3856-1]]] GNOME Bluetooth vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10910][CVE-2018-10910]]
- BlueZ doesn't necessarily make bluetooth device undiscoverable automatically after timeout
- Hence after enabling discovery would then still be discoverable even though user expectation is that is not anymore
- Actual bug then is really in BlueZ but now added a workaround in GNOME bluetooth to manually disable discovery

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3857-1/][USN-3857-1]]] PEAR vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1000888][CVE-2018-1000888]]
- PHP Extension and Application Repository - possible RCE when deserialising via PHP object injection
- Triggered when unpacking a PHAR (PHP ARchive) - also possible to sneak one into a JPEG so easy to exploit - just need image upload (Wordpress etc)

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20102][CVE-2018-20102]]
- Popular load balancing reverse proxy (used in OpenStack etc.)
- Infinite recursion from a pointer referencing itself or from long chains of pointers -> stack exhaustion -> crash -> DoS
- Out-of-bounds read when validating DNS responses - information disclosure of 16 bytes

** Goings on in Ubuntu and Linux Security Community
*** New page cache side-channel attack via mincore()
- Discovered by a team of researchers including some of those who found Spectre / Meltdown
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01161.pdf
- Uses mincore() system call on Linux to determine if pages exist in the page cache or not
- mincore() returns a bitmask of which pages are mapped in the cache for the requested range
- Can use this side-channel to either:
  - determine when a process calls a given function in a shared library (since the library will be mapped at the same address in both the attack and victim process)
    - need to first evict the given page from the cache which is difficult but authors propose a new efficient mechanism to do this
    - can then do things like UI redressing etc in response
  - Or can use this is a covert channel to leak information from one process to another
  - Can even use over the network to leak information via an innocent webserver etc
- Paper also describes an efficient cache eviction strategy
- Linus directly applied a fix (https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=574823bfab82d9d8fa47f422778043fbb4b4f50e)
  - This changes the behaviour of mincore() to only report pages which have been faulted into the cache by the calling process
    - So at best can now observe when a page is evicted from the cache but can't see when another process faults in a page
  - Breaks user-space API of mincore() and hence some existing programs (as noted in the commit)
    - Linus' primary rule is to never break userspace BUT in this case as is a security vulnerability this is okay
    - This might also likely affect other programs that use mincore in Ubuntu etc (fincore, e4defrag, qemu etc)
- Fix is not in the stable upstream kernel yet as waiting to see what fallout there is and so also has not been applied to Ubuntu kernels yet
- Also good discussion on LWN https://lwn.net/Articles/776801/ which highlights other avenues for inferring the contents of the page cache and other possible changes to mincore to protect against this attack
- Will be interesting to see where this all ends up

- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19787][CVE-2018-19787]]
- Popular XML/HTML parser for Python
- Tries to remove clean input document and remove links (to say embedded
  javascript code) - but doesn't account for links containing escaped
  characters - so link could persist
- Similar to CVE-2014-3146
  - In this case tried to account for whitespace in links but didn't include
    all possible whitespace characters

  current time *in seconds* as a seed for the relatively predictable PRNG
  - Easy to bruteforce / guess
  - Fix ensures to use current time value including microseconds
  - Still using relatively predictable PRNG - should use /dev/urandom etc

** Goings on in Linux Security Community
*** Linux on MIPS and home routers
- Cyber-ITL (Independent Testing Lab) analysed a number of home routers for basic security hardening features
  - ASLR, DEP (non-executable stack), RELRO
  - Mix of MIPS and ARM devices
  - Compared against Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x86_64 (general hardening)
  - Most found to have minimal hardening features enabled
  - https://cyber-itl.org/assets/papers/2018/build_safety_of_software_in_28_popular_home_routers.pdf
  - Also found Linux kernel on MIPS either has executable stack (until 2016)
    due to FP emulation code, or since then has no executable stack but has a
    RWX segment at a fixed location, which can be used to bypass DEP / ASLR
    - Ubuntu does not support MIPS

*** Final episode for 2018
- This is the last episode for 2018, on leave for the next 3 weeks
- Next episode will be from Cape Town in 2019 during week of 14th January with some special guests... :)

- Episode 14 covered CVE-2018-6559 (overlayfs / user namespace directory names disclosure)
  - Also fixed for Bionic and Xenial
- Episode 12 covered CVE-2018-17972 (procfs kernel stack disclosure)
- 3 CVEs discovered by Jann Horn (and one inadvertently caused by Jann too)
  - mremap() system call - used to expand or shrink an existing
    memory mapping and possibly move it - doesn't properly flush TLB - could
    leave pages in page cache for a short time which can then be raced to obtain
    access afterwards and possible DoS crash or information disclosure etc
    depending on target memory
  - Previous fix for CVE-2017-17852 (BPF verifier) discovered and also fixed by
    Jann, introduced a new vulnerability which would allow BPF programs to
    access memory out-of-bounds
  - Nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID mappings could allow
    processes with CAP_SYS_ADMIN within the namespace to access resources
    outside the namespace as the kernel would get confused on which UID to
    check against outside the namespace
    - Also fixed in Bionic and Xenial
- Vulnerability specific to the Ubuntu kernel used in Cosmic (18.10)
  - 2 bugs discovered as a result of using the secure boot lockdown patchset
    - Module signatures not properly enforced for UEFI Secure Boot - we had
      enabled the option to do this via IMA but had not then included the IMA
      policy to ensure this was enforced
      - Fixed by turning off option to verify modules using IMA
    - Secondary kernel keyring (ie where UEFI MOK goes from shim - used by
      DKMS) not trusted - so modules signed with it wouldn't work (except they
      do due to above)
      - Fixed to trust keys in secondary keyring for module signing

  but really more an issue in OpenSSL due to needing crypto code to be both
  constant time *and* execution flow independent of secret key
- Timing side-channels in ECDSA and DSA signature algorithms found by Samuel Weiser
  - Usual thing - variations in time-to-sign can be measured by attacker to recover private signing key

  - Multiple memory corruption issues which could lead to arbitrary code execution

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-3/][USN-3816-3]]] systemd regression
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
- Episode 12 & 13 - backport of large upstream patches to better handle symlink resolution in systemd-tmpfiles
- New code uses openat with O_PATH flag internally
- O_PATH was only introduced in Linux kernel 2.6.39
- Fails on pre-2.6.39 kernels - eg. OpenVZ
- So if running an Ubuntu Xenial kernel on OpenVZ systemd would fail to work correctly
- OpenVZ have released updated kernel as well to support O_PATH

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3829-1/][USN-3829-1]]] Git vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19486][CVE-2018-19486]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-15298][CVE-2017-15298]]
- Previously would execute commands from CWD, rather than from PATH
  - Could allow arbitrary code execution if using a malicious repository
- DoS due to large memory usage (Git Bomb) with specially crafted repository
  - Small repo with only 12 unique objects inside but that which are duplicated across the repo tree
  - Git would usually crash due to running out of memory BUT if did manage to
    survive and write to disk could consume a lot of disk space too
  - Only Trusty and Xenial affected (fixed already in Bionic etc)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3830-1/][USN-3830-1]]] OpenJDK regression
- Recent OpenJDK update (Episode 10) add stricter checking for JAR files
  - As a result, failed to find JAR files during build resulting in failed project builds
- New option should have been disabled by default to give time for other packages to be updated etc to deal wth new behaviour
  - Is now :)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3795-3/][USN-3795-3]]] libssh regression
- [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10933][CVE-2018-10933]] - covered in Episode 8
- Upstream fix introduced a regression which broke server-side keyboard authentication
- Server-side, not client-side
  - Not a common scenario used so unlikely to affect many users as need to use
    multiple interactive keyboard-based prompts to trigger (say password and
    token)
  - Server would be stuck
- Backport upstream fix

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3832-1/][USN-3832-1]], USN-3833-1] Linux kernel (AWS) vulnerabilities
- 6 CVEs addressed in Cosmic, first 2 in Bionic as well
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6559][CVE-2018-6559]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18955][CVE-2018-18955]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18281][CVE-2018-18281]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17972][CVE-2018-17972]]
- Philipp Wendler discovered Ubuntu specific flaw in the way user namespaces interact with overlayfs
- Allows regular users to list contents of directories which they do not have read-access to (ie could list /root)
- Create a user and a mount namespace and then mount an overlay via overlayfs within it
  - Within the overlayed mount, if say contained "root" and was mounted at the
    filesystem root (/), overlayfs would get confused about which permissions
    to use when running and would not use the real underlying permissions but
    would instead use the user supplied ones from the overlayed fs
- Relates to the fix for a previous CVE ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2015/CVE-2015-1328.html][CVE-2015-1328]])
  - This fix got dropped during Bionic development cycle so reintroduced this similar vulnerability
  - New test added to Ubuntu kernel test suite to ensure this does not regress again in the future

** Open Source Software Supply Chain Integrity
- NPM package (event-stream) got hijacked to inject code to target users of copay (Bitcoin wallet)
- Author of event-stream had lost interest, was emailed by a small contributor to take over maintenance and gave them ownership of the repo
  - Pushed a small change to add a new dependency to the package
  - This then contained code to try and bundle itself with target application - copay-dash
  - Targetted software supply chain at 2 points - event-stream repo / package AND getting into the build-system for copay-dash as a result
    - So would bundle bitcoin wallet stealing code into copay-dash
- 2 software supply chain attacks
  - Hard to fix first one since maintainers can lost interest and hand over to anyone
    - New owner may not have trust the old one did
    - npm doesn't care - is uncurated
  - Copay bundled and distributed dependencies so perhaps should have some responsibility to check those etc
- Ubuntu is based on Debian and both are curated repos
  - Packages are maintained by trusted developers
  - Much harder to mount a similar attach on Ubuntu / Debian archives due to
    barrier to entry as a trusted developer
  - Smaller dependency chains as well compared to npm so harder to hide such an attack as well
- Snap store is a different story though
- Bottom line - have to trust your software suppliers
  - Ubuntu - Canonical / trusted maintainers
  - Snap store - individual publishers

** Overview
This week we look at some details of the 16 unique CVEs addressed across the supported Ubuntu releases and more.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
16 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-2/][USN-3816-2]]] systemd vulnerability
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
- Episode 12 - original fix for CVE-2018-6954 was incomplete - this includes the complete fix
- Also includes an update to avoid a possible hang on shutdown in unattended-upgrades - [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1803391][LP #1803391]]
  - During shutdown, systemd is already in the process of shutting down
  - Then unattended-upgrades runs and it goes and tries to update systemd - which then tries to reexec it - which blocks waiting for it to finish shutting down
  - Creates a deadlock since systemd is waiting on unattended-upgrades to finish but u-u is waiting on systemd reexec
  - Fix is to not do reexec if systemd is already in the process of stopping

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3825-1/][USN-3825-1]], USN-3825-2] mod_perl vulnerability

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12388][CVE-2018-12388]]
- Firefox update (v63) (Episode 9) had some minor regressions
  - These were present in the upstream firefox release itself
- This provides [[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/63.0.3/releasenotes/][63.0.3]] which contains these fixes from upstream to address the regressions
  - WebGL hangs, slow page loading if using specific proxy settings etc.

** Overview
This week we look at some details of the 33 unique CVEs addressed across the
supported Ubuntu releases, including some significant updates for systemd and
the kernel, plus we talk about even more Intel side-channel vulnerabilities and
more.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
33 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3814-1/][USN-3814-1]]] libmspack vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18585][CVE-2018-18585]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18584][CVE-2018-18584]]
- Out of bounds write of 1 byte when a CAB file uses the maximum Quantum block size - buffer overflow, DoS -> crash, possible code execution
- Failure to validate filenames properly - could accept a filename with embedded NUL bytes - possible DoS -> crash

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3815-1/][USN-3815-1]], [[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3815-2/][USN-3815-2]]] gettext vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18751][CVE-2018-18751]]
- Double free for specially crafted translations file, DoS -> crash, possible code execution via heap corruption etc.
  - PoC's on github

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-1/][USN-3816-1]]] systemd vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6954][CVE-2018-6954]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15687][CVE-2018-15687]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15686][CVE-2018-15686]]
- Large backport of multiple patch series
- Jann Horn (GPZ) reported two issues to Ubuntu regarding systemd
  - possible to inject / alter state across re-execution of systemd itself (since serialized state) - but fails to deserialize it correctly
    - Insecure use of fgets() when parsing long lines
    - Possible root privilege escalation
  - When changing ownership of files in a directory via systemd (useful for executing a systemd unit as a given user for example to ensure files it needs are owned by that user)
    - Would try and handle symlinks specially BUT this is racy (since could change where pointed to during check of symlink and then actual work of chown() after)
    - So for instance, could convince systemd to possible change the ownership of a root owned file to that of another user
    - So could allow to change arbitrary files ownerships or even permissions
- Third issue - older one, systemd-tmpfiles could be used to obtain ownership of arbitrary files
  - Would follow symlinks in non-terminal path components, and then operate on the resulting file
  - Can tell it to set permissions / ownership of given files
  - So could race it to replace path components with symlinks to root-owned files and get it to change their ownership to that of the user (or whomeever)
  - Original patch series (March) didn't completely fix this - required much more invasive patching later
  - We waited to fix it until the complete fix was available and accepted upstream (August) to then start backporting
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3814-2/][USN-3814-2]], USN-3814-3] ClamAV vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM & Trusty
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18585][CVE-2018-18585]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-18584][CVE-2018-18584]]
- Same issues as for libmspack earlier (since clamav in Trusty and Precise ESM embeds libmspack, later releases use the system libmspack package instead)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3811-2/][USN-3811-2]]] SpamAssassin vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM

- Failure to initialize hash salt for PRNG in hash tables for elementtree (XML parser)
  - Could relatively easily cause hash-collisions on specially crafted document
  - High CPU and memory usage -> DoS
- Possible command injection when using Python to create a ZIP file archive
  - Used spawn() which is vulnerable to shell command injection -> subprocess()
- 3 lower priority issues
  - Race condition in when reading from multiple threads on same file - possible heap buffer overflow or UAF
  - DoS via CPU usage due to regexes in mail server response handling with backtracking - could be triggered by a malicious mail server
  - Similar but in regexes in difflib (catastrophic backtracking)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3818-1/][USN-3818-1]]] PostgreSQL vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16850][CVE-2018-16850]]
- Possible to inject arbitrary SQL with superuser privileges during dump/restore cycle

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** New Intel Side Channel Attacks (again...)
- [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05441.pdf][A Systematic Evaluation of Transient Execution Attacks and Defenses]]
- Reclassifies existing Meltdown and Spectre attacks with a new nomenclature
  - ie. original Meltdown is now Meltdown-US (US = User/Supervisor)
- Identifies a bunch of other possible variants for both Meltdown and Spectre
  - Meltdown-PK - bypass restrictions on Intel memory protection keys
  - Meltdown-BR - Spectre-like attack but using bounds-range exceeded exception to trigger
  - 5 new Spectre variants based on existing ones but targetting different
    microarchitectural elements (ie targetting the Branch Target Buffer when
    doing a Spectre-RSB attack since some processors fallback to BTB when RSB
    is empty)
- Compares existing mitigations for each existing and newly identified attack
- Very comprehensive, demonstrates the utility of such a complete analysis compared to existing approach where different researchers have looked at a single aspect
- Still an active area of research with new vulnerabilities turning up

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16395][CVE-2018-16395]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16396][CVE-2018-16396]]
- Misuses return value when comparing names in X509 certificates
  - If returned 1 on comparing name would assume are identical but are in fact not
  - Could allow to impersonate a certificate
- Taint flags not propagated when unpacking arrays into strings, or packing strings into arrays
  - Could allow untrusted data to be treated as trusted

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3809-1/][USN-3809-1]]] OpenSSH vulnerabilities
- 2 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15473][CVE-2018-15473]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-10708][CVE-2016-10708]]

  - Would take longer to process a packet with a valid username than an invalid one
  - Can determine account names as a result via brute-force timing attack
- Possible to crash the per-connection process on NULL pointer dereference
  - Low priority since doesn't crash the main daemon so not really a DoS

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3786-2/][USN-3786-2]]] libxkbcommon vulnerabilities
- 11 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15856][CVE-2018-15856]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-11574][CVE-2018-11574]]
- Ubuntu specific change to pppd to add support for EAP-TLS authentication
  - Could be triggered on both peer or server side
  - Lack of input validation coupled with an integer overflow lead to crash and possible authentication bypass
  - Leads to memcpy() with a negative length value (and hence very large unsigned value)
  - Theoretically possible to overwrite other data structures related to server state and therefore bypass authentication

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3811-1/][USN-3811-1]]] SpamAssassin vulnerabilities
- 3 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1060][PortSmash]] - New Intel side-channel vulnerability or expected behaviour for SMT?
- [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-5407.html][CVE-2018-5407]] assigned to OpenSSL but described as a side-channel in Intel SMT / Hyper-Threading
  - https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/11/01/4
  - Affects OpenSSL <= 1.1.0h
- [[https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/12/8][Originally suggested as a possible side-channel in 2015]]
- Due to sharing of execution engines in SMT
  - Two processes across shared hyper-threads, contend for execution units across same ports
  - Meaure port contention delay -> side channel to recover ECDSA private key of server running in other process
- So crypto code needs not only to be constant-time, but also secret-independent execution-flow
  - ie. execute same instruction sequence regardless of secret
  - all code and data addresses are assumed public
- Or disable HT / learn to schedule trust domains across different hyper-threads (gang-scheduling)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3802-1/][USN-3802-1]]] X.Org X server vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14665][CVE-2018-14665]]
- Incorrect permissions check for 2 command-line arguments (-modulepath and -logfile)
- On *some* platforms (not Ubuntu) Xorg itself is setuid
- Can then use these command-line options to overwrite arbitrary files etc -> privilege escalation to root via say overwrite of /etc/shadow
- Generated a lot of press - *BUT* missed the distinction that Xorg is not really setuid on Ubuntu
- We use Xorg.wrap as setuid to first run and drop permissions if using KMS driver
  - This is the case for the vast majority of drivers, and for almost all free drivers
  - So most Ubuntu users unaffected by this vulnerability
- Special Friday release :)

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-12376][CVE-2018-12376]]
- New Thunderbird version (60) containing 5 fixes
- Interestingly *all* of these were also vulnerabilities in Firefox - in
  particular CVE-2018-12383 was discussed in Episode 4 for Firefox

- 5 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-15378][CVE-2018-15378]]
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14682][CVE-2018-14682]]

- Corresponding fix for Precise ESM from ClamAV which we discussed in Episode 7
- Also rolls in fixes for 4 other vulnerabilities in the embedded mspack library
  - In trusty and precise we used the embedded libmspack, newer releases use

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3795-1/][USN-3795-1]]] libssh vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10933][CVE-2018-10933]]
- Embedded SSH server and client implementation
- Allows bypass of authentication by remote attackers if they send a SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS message instead of the SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message to initiate the authentication process
- This message is meant to be sent from the server to the client but in this case are sending it *to the server*
- State machine on server-side then jumps straight to 'Authenticated'
- Only affects applications which use libssh as a server

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3796-1/][USN-3796-1]], USN-3796-2] Paramiko vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic & Precise ESM
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1000805][CVE-2018-1000805]]
- Python SSH library for both servers and clients
- Very similar to CVE-2018-10933 for libssh - remote authentication bypass by presenting SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS in place of SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
- Due to code-reuse between client and server implementations
- On server side, runs the normal client side code to be used when receiving this authentication success from the server, and flips the 'authenticated' flag - which is shared by both the server and client code

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish Released
- Includes OpenSSL 1.1.1 for TLS 1.3 support
- Support for using fingerprint readers to unlock screen etc
  - Ubuntu Security Team consider fingerprints to be akin to usernames only - so we don't enable fingerprint authentication by default - need to opt-in
  - libfprint and fprintd promoted to main to allow this
*** Ubuntu CVE Tracker facelift
- Refreshed look and feel via bootstrap
- https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/

17 unique CVEs addressed
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3771-1/][USN-3771-1]]] strongSwan vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5388][CVE-2018-5388]]

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10811][CVE-2018-10811]]
- 2 CVEs: flaws in RSA implementation allow Bleichenbacher-style attacks in parsing of the ASN.1 encoded digestInfo
- strongSwan implementation was too lenient and would allow arbitrary random data to be contained following various elements in the ASN.1
- Also would not check the correct amount of padding had been used
- Allows attackers to potentially forge low-exponent signature forgery and hence authentication during IKE authentication
- 2 CVEs for DoS due to missing length check and missing variable initialization
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3772-1/][USN-3772-1]]] UDisks vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-17336][CVE-2018-17336]]
- Format string vulnerability which could be exploited via specially crafted disk label
- udisks prints volume label via printf() passing the label as part of the format string
  - Simple fix to replace the label with a %s directive and then pass the label to that
  - ie. don't interpret label as printf() directives directly

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** LSM Stacking upstreaming
- Casey Schaufler (Intel, SMACK maintainer) primary developer along with John Johansen and Kees Cook (Google) to upstream support for LSM stacking
- Currently upstream allows use of one 'major' module (SELinux / AppArmor / Tomoyo) with a minor module (Yama etc)
- Goal of stacking is to allow multiple major modules to be used in conjunction (AppArmor with SELinux)
  - Primary use-case is containers
- Current stacking patches allow to stack Tomoyo with either SELinux / AppArmor
  - Eventually should be able to stack SELinux with AppArmor but still WIP
  - Ubuntu already carries these patches in Bionic etc
- Likely to be merged in the near future
*** Evince AppArmor hardening [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evince/+bug/1788929][LP #1788929]]
- Jann Horn (GPZ) reported gaps in evince AppArmor profile
- Clever use of GNOME thumbnailer infrastructure to specify a new 'evil' thumbnailer and the use of systemd via DBus to escape AppArmor confinement
- Policy fixed in Cosmic, in process of updating for Bionic etc

- Ghostscript is used to process Postscript (and other formats) - PS is Turing
  Complete so in general is unsafe
- Hence Ghostscript includes a sandbox (-dSAFER) to try and prevent issues with
  handling of untrusted files
- Tavis Ormandy previously found a number of issues in the SAFER sandbox which
  allowed escape from it and execution of commands (ie. CVE-2016-7977 etc.)
- Recently discovered more - including ability to execute arbitrary code.

- Transport Independent RPC Library, used by NFS
- 1 medium priority issue:
  - Crash from NULL pointer dereference when run out of file descriptions (failure to check return value) - a remote attacker could cause crash by flooding with new connections
- 2 low priority issues:
  - "rpcbomb" - allows an unauthenticated attacker to DoS via memory exhaustion
  - Stack based buffer overflow could cause a crash when flooded by ICMP and UDP packets in the sunrpc implementation - fixed by replacing stack based memory allocation with heap-based allocation instead
  - Common pattern to fix this type of issue - similar work in Linux kernel recently by KSPP to replace VLAs

- Latest firefox release (62) fixing a number of issues including DoS and RCE
- One interesting one is CVE-2018-12383 - in Firefox 58 the password storage
  format was changed (was sqlite, then was changed to json). When user sets a
  master password, this is used to encrypt all stored passwords. However, this
  was only done for the copy stored with the new format - the old copy would
  still be stored unencrypted since it never had a master password set on
  it. This is now fixed to simply delete the old copy of the password DB.

*** Discussions around hardening guides for Ubuntu
- A number of 'best practices' guides exist for hardening Ubuntu installations from reputable organisations
  - [[https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-ubuntu-1804-lts][NCSC]]
  - [[https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux/][CIS Benchmarks]]
  - many others
- In general these have similar recommendations:
  - Use UEFI Secure Boot
  - Disable unnecesary services
  - Use a known and fixed networking configuration (disable DHCP / use VPN etc)
  - Enable Mandatory Access Control frameworks (ie. AppArmor)
  - Use a specific password policy
  - Enable auditing
- Differ in level of detail and technical knowledge needed to deploy
- Typically aimed at computer and network administrators (not end-users)
- Ubuntu already includes a number of these recommendations out of the box:
  - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features
- Ubuntu strives to strike a balance between security and usability out-of-the-box

- Intel microcode updates to address L1TF, Spectre Variant 4 and Rogue System Register Read (RSRE)
- Intel initially released this with a brand new license which included terms around disallowing benchmarking and possibly preventing redistribution via the Ubuntu mirrors
  - As a result, we couldn't provide updated microcode packages to full address L1TF etc
  - Intel have now reverted back to the license used on previous microcode packages and so this can now finally be released

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community
*** MIR Process and bubblewrap
- Security team is responsible for doing security audits of packages which are proposed to be included in the main section of the Ubuntu package repository
  - Packages in main are officially maintained, supported and recommended so deserve a high level of scrutiny before promotion into main
  - Security team historically only provides security updates to packages in main as well
  - So we have to be confident we can maintain and support a given package
- To perform the security review we look at a number of things:
  - The code is evaluated to determine how easy or not it would be to maintain
  - The package itself is evaluated to look for potential issues
  - Code is then evaluated to look for potential existing security vulnerabilities
- This can be a time consuming process, especially to do well
- Recently this was in the news, when Hanno Böck (infosec journalist and
  researcher) and Tavis Ormandy (GPZ) raised the issue of lack of bubblewrap
  support for gnome desktop thumbnailers
  - bubblewrap provides support for sandboxing processes via namespaces and the
    use of it to sandbox desktop thumbnailers was introduced in the GNOME 3.26
    release
  - It was planned to be supported for Ubuntu 18.04, but to do this the package
    had to be moved from universe into main, hence a MIR
  - Due to shifting priorities, the security team was not able to get this done
    in time and hence the feature had to be disabled
  - This MIR is being proritised now so this security hardening feature should be available in an upcoming release
  - Security team is also looking at how to strengthen the hardening via AppArmor MAC profiles in addition
  - Thanks to Hanno and Tavis for giving this greater visibility

  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14526][CVE-2018-14526]]
- Researchers analysed WPA2 4-way handshake via symbolic execution to find weaknesses
  - Found a number of issues including a decryption oracle
  - In this case, the would decrypt but not authenticate frame and then could allow recovery of the group key via a timing side-channel
  - In theory, allows an unauthenticated attacker to recover WPA2 group key via frame manipulation when used with TKIP
    - NOTE: is not advised to use TKIP in practice anyway (should use WPA2/CCMP) and so should have limited applicability
  - In practice, due to large number of attempts needed to recover the full key, this is impractical (especially given that the group key is changed periodically)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3746-1/][USN-3746-1]]] APT vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-0501][CVE-2018-0501]]
- Dubbed "mirror fail" by the author and even a website - https://mirror.fail/
- mirror protocol in apt allows to specify a list of mirrors to try rather than just a single mirror in source.list
  - not enabled by default
- in APT 1.6 this was reworked and a bug introduced
  - on fallback from one mirror to the next, the previous mirrors InRelease file would be used without checking the one from the new mirror
  - hence failing to authenticate the one from the new mirror
  - could potentially allow installation of untrusted packages BUT would need at least two mirrors to be compromised AND for the user to have setup use of multiple mirrors in the first place

**** L1TF ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3620][CVE-2018-3620]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3646][CVE-2018-3646]])
- Latest speculative execution cache side channel attack affecting Intel processors
- Allows to access contents from L1 Data Cache via speculative execution,  can then be read by cache side channel
- 3 variants, SGX, SMM and VMM but only 2 affect Ubuntu
- Processors access virtual addresses which need to be translated to physical addresses
- Page Table Entries map from one to the other (contains metadata of page including offset and present bit)
- Pages can be swapped in our out of memory (Present or not) - so if not present then need to do a full page table walk to look up physical address
- But Intel processor will use offset value from PTE even on non-present pages *speculatively*
- For non-present pages, this value is usually junk so can essentially speculatively read arbitrary memory from L1D cache depending on PTE value
- SGX doesn't affect Ubuntu since not used
- SMM fixed via ensuring PTEs of not present pages always refer to non-cacheable memory and hence can't be used for this
- VMM is trickier
  - VMs maintain their own PTEs so also need to ensure they are doing the right thing
  - OR if running untrusted VMs need to do a full L1D flush on switching from host to VM
- Made more trickier by Hyper Threading since sibling hyper-threads share the L1D cache
- So if have different trust domains on sibling hyper-threads may have to disable HT in certain circumstances
**** FragmentSmack ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5391][CVE-2018-5391]])
- Last week was SegmentSmack in TCP fragment reassembly, this week is FragmentSmack
- Similar but for IP fragmentation reassembly
  - Exploiting high algorithmic complexity of IP fragment reassembly code paths to cause DoS
*** GnuPG ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3733-2/][USN-3733-2]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7526][CVE-2017-7526]])
- Last week GnuPG was fixed for Xenial and Trusty for RSA cache side-channel issue
- This is corresponding fix for Precise ESM

- Efforts to enable AppArmor by default in Debian Buster (10)
- Ongoing work to upstream the latest AppArmor changes
  - Course-grained network mediation (AF_INET / AF_IET6)
  - DBus mediation
    - Almost all are now in Linux kernel 4.19
  - Some remain for 4.20
    - Unix sockets
- Future directions for AppArmor
  - IMA-aware policy (in 4.17, requires AppArmor 3.0 userspace)
    - Contributed by Google, hopefully will be available soon
  - Fine-grained networking mediation (ie. port level mediation)
  - Shared memory mediation
  - cgroups
  - overlayfs
  - user specific policy
- Multiple namespaces support for AppArmor
  - LXD / libvirt / snapd / docker
  - policy within a namespace (and policy outside the namespace too)
- Demo of LXD with namespaced policy
- https://debconf18.debconf.org/talks/106-apparmor-30/
