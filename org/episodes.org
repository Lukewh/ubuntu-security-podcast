** Introduction
*** What will be covered
- Overview of latest security updates for Ubuntu
- In depth discussion of trending CVEs
- Other things the team has been up to
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
*** SegmentSmack ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5390][CVE-2018-5390]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3732-1/][USN-3732-1]])
- DoS via expensive algorithmic computation in TCP stream reassembly
- Requires attacker to have an existing TCP session
- Affecting kernel >= 4.9
- Fixed in Bionic and Xenial for HWE
- No known exploits in the wild
*** linux kernel ([[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2018-August/004529.html][LSN-0041-1]])
- brief description of livepatch
- Several issues (5 CVEs)
  - stack overflow in SCSI / cdrom layers ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-11506][CVE-2018-11506]])
  - DoS / crash via specially crafted ext4 filesystem ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-1094][CVE-2018-1094]])
  - files can be created with group permissions which the original owner did not have within sgid directories ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-13405][CVE-2018-13405]])
    - Originally reported by Jann Horn in relation to whoopsie / apport in Ubuntu
  - DoS / crash via specially crafted xfs filesystem ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-13094][CVE-2018-13094]])
  - SegmentSmack fix ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5390][CVE-2018-5390]])
- generic & lowlatency kernels for Trusty, Xenial and Bionic
*** gnupg ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7526][CVE-2017-7526]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3733-1/][USN-3733-1]])
- Cache side-channel attack on RSA implementation
- When CVE was created, only assigned to libgcrypt
- gnupg quietly announced 1.4.23 as fixing this CVE as well in June
  - Turns out was actually fixed in 1.4.22
  - So Bionic etc not affected
- Fixed in Trusty and Xenial
- No known exploits in the wild
*** openjdk ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-2952][CVE-2018-2952]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3734-1/][USN-3734-1]])
- Denial of service via excessive memory consumption
- openjdk-7 in trusty and openjdk-8 in xenial
*** lxc ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6556][CVE-2018-6556]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3730-1/][USN-3730-1]])
- Allows opening (but not reading) of arbitrary files
  - Information disclosure / DoS since could open pseudoterminals or other kernel devices and cause exhausting of resources
- For lxc >=2.0 - bionic, xenial-backports
*** libxcursor ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-9262][CVE-2015-9262]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3729-1/][USN-3729-1]])
- Classic off-by-one error - string allocation but forgot to allocate byte for NUL terminator
  - As on the heap allows heap memory corruption
  - Possible code execution etc
  - In handling of cursor themes so could be triggered when loading a malicious themes
- Affects libxcursor in trusty and xenial - both fixed
*** lftp ([[http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10196][CVE-2018-10196]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3731-1/][USN-3731-1]])
- Command-line FTP / HTTP / BitTorrent clients
- Does not properly validate filenames from server when mirroring locally
  - Could allow a malicious server to remove all files in PWD
- Fixed in Bionic, Xenial, Trusty & *Precise ESM*

** Goings on in Ubuntu Security
*** NCSC publish Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Security Guide
- A couple weeks old now, but worth mentioning
- National Cyber Security Centre in UK
  - Provide infosec guidance to public and private sector
- Focuses around End User Devices deployed for remote work but applies equally to home / office as well
- Covers guidance such as:
  - VPN
  - Enforcing a given password policy
  - UEFI Secure Boot
  - Livepatch
  - Firewall configuration
  - Auditing
- https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/eud-security-guidance-ubuntu-1804-lts
- https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/07/30/national-cyber-security-centre-publish-ubuntu-18-04-lts-security-guide
*** Seth Arnold's AppArmor 3.0 presentation at DebConf
- Overview of AppArmor with brief history and walkthough of main features
- Efforts to enable AppArmor by default in Debian Buster (10)
- Ongoing work to upstream the latest AppArmor changes
  - Course-grained network mediation (AF_INET / AF_IET6)
  - DBus mediation
    - Almost all are now in Linux kernel 4.19
  - Some remain for 4.20
    - Unix sockets
- Future directions for AppArmor
  - IMA-aware policy (in 4.17, requires AppArmor 3.0 userspace)
    - Contributed by Google, hopefully will be available soon
  - Fine-grained networking mediation (ie. port level mediation)
  - Shared memory mediation
  - cgroups
  - overlayfs
  - user specific policy
- Multiple namespaces support for AppArmor
  - LXD / libvirt / snapd / docker
  - policy within a namespace (and policy outside the namespace too)
- Demo of LXD with namespaced policy
- https://debconf18.debconf.org/talks/106-apparmor-30/
