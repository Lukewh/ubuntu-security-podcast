L1TF kernel regressions, WPA2 key recovery, mirror fail and more!
#+end_description
** Overview
83 unique CVEs addressed across the supported Ubuntu releases.
** This week in Ubuntu Security Updates
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-3/][USN-3742-3]]] Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) regressions
- Security team issues USNs for package updates caused by regressions in previous security updates
- Fix for regressions caused by the original kernel update for L1TF
- Could cause Java applications to fail to start and possible kernel panics on
  boot for some hardware configurations
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3745-1/][USN-3745-1]]] wpa_supplicant and hostapd vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-14526][CVE-2018-14526]]
- Researchers analysed WPA2 4-way handshake via symbolic execution to find weaknesses
  - Found a number of issues including a decryption oracle
  - In this case, the would decrypt but not authenticate frame and then could allow recovery of the group key via a timing side-channel
  - In theory, allows an unauthenticated attacker to recover WPA2 group key via frame manipulation when used with TKIP
    - NOTE: is not advised to use TKIP in practice anyway (should use WPA2/CCMP) and so should have limited applicability
  - In practice, due to large number of attempts needed to recover the full key, this is impractical (especially given that the group key is changed periodically)

*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3746-1/][USN-3746-1]]] APT vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-0501][CVE-2018-0501]]
- Dubbed "mirror fail" by the author and even a website - https://mirror.fail/
- mirror protocol in apt allows to specify a list of mirrors to try rather than just a single mirror in source.list
  - not enabled by default
- in APT 1.6 this was reworked and a bug introduced
  - on fallback from one mirror to the next, the previous mirrors InRelease file would be used without checking the one from the new mirror
  - hence failing to authenticate the one from the new mirror
  - could potentially allow installation of untrusted packages BUT would need at least two mirrors to be compromised AND for the user to have setup use of multiple mirrors in the first place
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3748-1/][USN-3748-1]]] base-files vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-6557][CVE-2018-6557]]
- Vulnerability in the motd update script via insecure use of temporary files
  - Could allow DoS or privelege escalation if user has turned off kernel symlink restrictions
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3751-1/][USN-3751-1]]] Spice vulnerability
- 1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
  - [[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-10873][CVE-2018-10873]]
- Insufficient bounds checks could allow to crash a server OR client from an authenticated peer
- Requires authentication
*** [[[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3747-1/][USN-3747-1]]] OpenJDK 10 vulnerabilities
- 4 CVEs addressed in Bionic

** Overview
- Security fixes for 39 CVEs this week including L1TF and FragmentSmack

- Found by Ubuntu Security Team member Chris Coulson during audit of gdm3 source code
- Local user can exploit via DBus to crash GDM via use-after-free (create a transient display which is automatically cleaned up, then try to query info for the previously created display)
- Bionic only so far

*** L1TF and FragmentSmack vulnerabilities in Linux Kernel ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-1/][USN-3740-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3740-2/][USN-3740-2]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-1/][USN-3741-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3741-2/][USN-3741-2]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-1/][USN-3742-1]]) ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3742-2/][USN-3742-2]])
**** L1TF ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3620][CVE-2018-3620]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-3646][CVE-2018-3646]])
- Latest speculative execution cache side channel attack affecting Intel processors
- Allows to access contents from L1 Data Cache via speculative execution,  can then be read by cache side channel
- 3 variants, SGX, SMM and VMM but only 2 affect Ubuntu
- Processors access virtual addresses which need to be translated to physical addresses
- Page Table Entries map from one to the other (contains metadata of page including offset and present bit)
- Pages can be swapped in our out of memory (Present or not) - so if not present then need to do a full page table walk to look up physical address
- But Intel processor will use offset value from PTE even on non-present pages *speculatively*
- For non-present pages, this value is usually junk so can essentially speculatively read arbitrary memory from L1D cache depending on PTE value
- SGX doesn't affect Ubuntu since not used
- SMM fixed via ensuring PTEs of not present pages always refer to non-cacheable memory and hence can't be used for this
- VMM is trickier
  - VMs maintain their own PTEs so also need to ensure they are doing the right thing
  - OR if running untrusted VMs need to do a full L1D flush on switching from host to VM
- Made more trickier by Hyper Threading since sibling hyper-threads share the L1D cache
- So if have different trust domains on sibling hyper-threads may have to disable HT in certain circumstances
**** FragmentSmack ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-5391][CVE-2018-5391]])
- Last week was SegmentSmack in TCP fragment reassembly, this week is FragmentSmack
- Similar but for IP fragmentation reassembly
  - Exploiting high algorithmic complexity of IP fragment reassembly code paths to cause DoS
*** GnuPG ([[https://usn.ubuntu.com/3733-2/][USN-3733-2]]) ([[https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7526][CVE-2017-7526]])
- Last week GnuPG was fixed for Xenial and Trusty for RSA cache side-channel issue
- This is corresponding fix for Precise ESM

- Efforts to enable AppArmor by default in Debian Buster (10)
- Ongoing work to upstream the latest AppArmor changes
  - Course-grained network mediation (AF_INET / AF_IET6)
  - DBus mediation
    - Almost all are now in Linux kernel 4.19
  - Some remain for 4.20
    - Unix sockets
- Future directions for AppArmor
  - IMA-aware policy (in 4.17, requires AppArmor 3.0 userspace)
    - Contributed by Google, hopefully will be available soon
  - Fine-grained networking mediation (ie. port level mediation)
  - Shared memory mediation
  - cgroups
  - overlayfs
  - user specific policy
- Multiple namespaces support for AppArmor
  - LXD / libvirt / snapd / docker
  - policy within a namespace (and policy outside the namespace too)
- Demo of LXD with namespaced policy
- https://debconf18.debconf.org/talks/106-apparmor-30/
